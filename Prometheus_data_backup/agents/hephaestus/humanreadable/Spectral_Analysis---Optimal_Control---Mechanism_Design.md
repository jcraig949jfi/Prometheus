## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
1. **Parsing & feature extraction** – For each candidate answer we scan the text with a deterministic finite‑state transducer that emits a binary time‑series `x[t]` (one token per position). The transducer flags structural primitives: negation (`¬`), comparative (`>`/`<`), conditional (`if … then`), causal cue (`because`, `leads to`), numeric literal, and ordering relation (`first`, `last`). Each primitive gets its own channel, yielding a multivariate signal **X** ∈ ℝ^{T×K} (T tokens, K≈6 features).  
2. **Spectral representation** – Compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of each channel with `np.fft.rfft`, obtaining magnitude spectra **S** ∈ ℝ^{F×K} (F frequency bins). The power spectral density (PSD) is `|S|^2`. This captures periodic patterns of logical structure (e.g., alternating conditionals).  
3. **Optimal‑control cost** – Let **S\*** be the PSD of a reference (gold) answer. Define a quadratic cost  
   \[
   J(w)=\|W\odot (S-S^*)\|_2^2+\lambda\|w\|_2^2,
   \]  
   where `w`∈ℝ^K are channel‑wise weights, `⊙` denotes column‑wise scaling, and λ controls smoothness (control effort). The optimal `w*` solves the linear system  
   \[
   (2\,(S-S^*)^\top (S-S^*)+2\lambda I)w = 2\,(S-S^*)^\top S^*,
   \]  
   which is a standard LQR‑type solution obtained with `np.linalg.solve`.  
4. **Mechanism‑design scoring** – The final score for a candidate is the negative cost:  
   \[
   \text{score}= -J(w^*).
   \]  
   Because the scoring rule is a proper quadratic loss (negative Brier‑type), it is incentive‑compatible: agents maximizing expected score must report their true belief about the answer’s logical‑spectral match.  

**Structural features parsed** – negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal cues, numeric literals, ordering relations (first/last, before/after). Each appears as a token‑level flag in the multivariate signal.  

**Novelty** – The pipeline fuses spectral signal processing (periodic logical pattern detection) with optimal‑control weight tuning and a proper scoring rule from mechanism design. While each component exists separately (spectral feature extraction in NLP, LQR for parameter tuning, proper scoring rules for truthful elicitation), their concrete combination—using the PSD of logical‑feature time series as the state in an LQR problem to learn incentive‑compatible weights—has not been reported in the literature.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures deep logical periodicity and optimizes alignment with a reference answer.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the method can reflect on its own weight vector but lacks higher‑order self‑monitoring.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — generates hypotheses via spectral peaks but does not explore alternative logical structures beyond linear weighting.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on NumPy and stdlib; all steps are deterministic linear algebra and FFT.
