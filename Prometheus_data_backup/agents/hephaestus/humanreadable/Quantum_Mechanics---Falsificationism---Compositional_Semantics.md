## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
Each candidate answer is first turned into a *propositional tensor* using compositional semantics. A shallow parser built from regex extracts atomic propositions — predicate‑argument tuples with polarity (positive/negative), modality weight ∈ [0,1] (certainty from cues like “probably”, “must”), and any attached numeric or ordering constraints. These atoms become basis vectors |pᵢ⟩ in a Hilbert‑space‑like structure; the joint state is the tensor product ⊗ᵢ|pᵢ⟩, stored as a NumPy array of shape (2,…,2) where each dimension corresponds to an atom’s truth value (0 = false, 1 = true). The modality weights are applied as amplitude coefficients aᵢ = √wᵢ, giving a normalized state |Ψ⟩ = (⊗ᵢ aᵢ|1⟩ + √(1‑wᵢ)|0⟩).  

Falsificationism supplies the *measurement*: we generate N random worlds by sampling each variable’s domain (numeric ranges from extracted constants, boolean for predicates) using `numpy.random`. For each world we compute the projective measurement outcome M(w) = ⟨w|Ψ⟩², i.e., the probability that the world satisfies the entire tensor. Worlds where M(w) < τ (a small threshold, e.g., 0.05) are counted as falsified. The final score is  

`score = 1 – (falsified_worlds / N)`  

Higher scores indicate answers that survive more attempted falsifications, analogous to Popper’s bold conjectures that resist refutation.  

**Structural features parsed**  
- Negations (`not`, `no`)  
- Comparatives (`>`, `<`, `≥`, `≤`, `more than`, `less than`)  
- Conditionals (`if … then`, `unless`)  
- Causal markers (`because`, `leads to`, `results in`)  
- Temporal/ordering terms (`before`, `after`, `while`)  
- Numeric quantities and units  
- Quantifiers (`all`, `some`, `none`)  

**Novelty**  
Pure compositional semantics or weighted model counting exist, and falsification‑inspired scoring appears in probabilistic logic programming. The specific fusion—treating extracted propositions as a quantum‑like superposition, measuring falsifiability via random world sampling, and scoring survival probability—has not been described in the literature, making the combination novel.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure and uncertainty while providing a clear falsification‑based score.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the method can estimate its own confidence via the amplitude weights but does not explicitly reason about its reasoning process.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — focuses on evaluating given answers; generating new hypotheses would require additional generative components.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex, NumPy array operations, and random sampling; no external libraries or APIs needed.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Quantum Mechanics**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Falsificationism**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 34% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.
- **Compositional Semantics**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 

- Compositional Semantics + Falsificationism: negative interaction (-0.105). Keep these concepts in separate code paths to avoid interference.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Apoptosis + Falsificationism + Self-Organized Criticality (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Attention Mechanisms + Predictive Coding + Falsificationism (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Chaos Theory + Falsificationism + Maximum Entropy (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
