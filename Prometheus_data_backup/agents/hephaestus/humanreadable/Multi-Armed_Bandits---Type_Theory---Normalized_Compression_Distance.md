## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
We build a Python class `BanditTypeNCDScorer` that, given a prompt `P` and a list of candidate answers `C = [c₁,…,c_K]`, returns a score for each `c_k`.  

1. **Type‑theoretic front‑end** – A deterministic parser (hand‑written regex + shallow‑dependency rules) extracts a *typed logical form* (TLF) from any string.  
   - Grammar: `Clause ::= (Pred, Arg₁, Arg₂, …)` where `Pred` is typed (`negation`, `comparative`, `conditional`, `causal`, `quantifier`, `numeric`).  
   - Each clause is stored as a NumPy structured array: `dtype=[('pred','U12'),('args','U32',(max_arity,))]`.  
   - The parser also produces a *constraint graph* `G` where nodes are atomic propositions and edges represent transitivity (ordering), modus ponens (conditional → consequent), and contradiction (negation).  

2. **Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) arms** – Three similarity arms are defined:  
   - **Arm 0 (Raw)**: NCD(`c_k`, `ref`) on the original strings.  
   - **Arm 1 (TLF‑norm)**: NCD(`serialize(TLF(c_k))`, `serialize(TLF(ref))`).  
   - **Arm 2 (Closure)**: First apply constraint propagation on `G` to derive all implied clauses (forward chaining until fix‑point), serialize the closed set, then compute NCD.  
   NCD is approximated with the standard library’s `zlib.compress`: `NCD(x,y) = (C(xy) – min(C(x),C(y))) / max(C(x),C(y))`, where `C` is byte length after compression. Similarity for arm i is `s_i = 1 – NCD_i`.  

3. **Multi‑Armed Bandit selector** – Treat each arm as a bandit. Maintain counts `n_i` and average rewards `\bar{s}_i`. After evaluating a candidate, compute the Upper Confidence Bound:  
   `UCB_i = \bar{s}_i + sqrt(2 * ln(t) / n_i)`, where `t` is total evaluations so far.  
   Choose the arm with maximal UCB, observe its similarity `s_i`, update `\bar{s}_i` and `n_i`. The final score for the candidate is the weighted sum `\sum_i p_i * s_i` where `p_i = n_i / t`.  

**Parsed structural features**  
- Negations (`not`, `no`, `never`) → `negation` predicate.  
- Comparatives (`more than`, `<`, `greater`) → `comparative` with direction.  
- Conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`) → `conditional` antecedent/consequent.  
- Causal cues (`because`, `leads to`, `results in`) → `causal`.  
- Numeric values and units (`3 kg`, `≈5.2`) → `numeric` with magnitude and unit tags.  
- Ordering/temporal relations (`before`, `after`, `older than`) → encoded as ordering constraints in `G`.  
- Quantifiers (`all`, `some`, `none`) → `quantifier` type for scope checking.  

**Novelty**  
Pure compression‑based similarity (e.g., NCD) and pure logical‑form scoring exist separately, as do bandit‑driven ensemble methods. Tightly integrating a type‑theoretic parser that produces a constraint‑closed logical representation, then using a bandit to dynamically weight NCD computed on raw, normalized, and closed forms, is not described in prior literature to our knowledge, making the combination novel.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — The method captures logical structure and uncertainty, yielding scores that reflect both semantic similarity and deductive consistency.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — Bandit feedback provides a rudimentary self‑monitoring of which representation works best, but no explicit higher‑order reasoning about the process itself.  
Implementability: 9/10 — Only regex, NumPy arrays, and zlib are required; all components are straightforward to code in pure Python/stdlib.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — The system can propose alternative parses via bandit exploration, yet it lacks generative mechanisms for creating novel hypotheses beyond re‑weighting existing parses.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Multi-Armed Bandits**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Type Theory**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Normalized Compression Distance**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 

- Multi-Armed Bandits + Type Theory: strong positive synergy (+0.327). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Epigenetics + Multi-Armed Bandits + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Multi-Armed Bandits + Free Energy Principle + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Pragmatics + Multi-Armed Bandits + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
