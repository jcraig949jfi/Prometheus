## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm: Fractal‑Analogical Constraint‑Scoring (FACS)**  

1. **Data structures**  
   * `PromptGraph` – a directed labeled multigraph where nodes are *semantic primitives* (entities, attributes, quantifiers) extracted via regex‑based pattern matching (e.g., “X is Y”, “if A then B”, “more than”, “not”). Edges carry relation types (`is‑a`, `has‑property`, `causes`, `greater‑than`, `equals`).  
   * `AnswerGraphs` – one graph per candidate answer, built with the same extractor.  
   * `FeatureVectors` – NumPy arrays of shape `(n_nodes, n_relation_types)` where each entry is the count of incident edges of that type; optionally normalized to unit L2 norm.  
   * `StrategyProfile` – a probability distribution over *analogical mapping strategies* (e.g., strict isomorphic mapping, relaxed homomorphic mapping, partial‑match mapping). Represented as a NumPy vector that sums to 1.  

2. **Operations**  
   * **Graph construction** – deterministic regex pass yields node/edge lists; stored in SciPy‑compatible CSR matrices for fast multiplication.  
   * **Structure‑mapping similarity** – for each answer graph `A` and the prompt graph `P`, compute the *graph‑kernal* `S = trace((A·Pᵀ)·(A·Pᵀ)ᵀ)`, which counts matching edge‑type pairs under a given mapping. This is analogous to the Hausdorff‑dimension self‑similarity measure: we iteratively apply a set of *function systems* (node‑type renaming, edge‑type substitution) and record the scaling of matches; the slope in log‑log space yields a fractal dimension estimate `D`.  
   * **Constraint propagation** – run a deterministic closure (transitivity of `is‑a`, `greater‑than`, modus ponens on conditionals) on both graphs; mismatches after closure incur a penalty proportional to the number of violated constraints.  
   * **Nash equilibrium scoring** – treat each mapping strategy as a player in a zero‑sum game where the payoff is the similarity score `S` minus constraint penalty. Compute the mixed‑strategy Nash equilibrium via solving a small linear program (using `scipy.optimize.linprog` from the stdlib‑compatible `numpy.linalg.lstsq` fallback). The equilibrium probability weight assigned to the *exact‑isomorphic* strategy becomes the final answer score.  

3. **Structural features parsed**  
   * Negations (`not`, `no`, `never`) → edge label `neg`.  
   * Comparatives (`more than`, `less than`, `as … as`) → `greater‑than`, `less‑than`, `equal`.  
   * Conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`) → directed `implies` edges.  
   * Causal verbs (`cause`, `lead to`, `result in`) → `causes`.  
   * Numeric values and units → attribute nodes with `value` property.  
   * Ordering relations (`first`, `last`, `before`, `after`) → temporal edges.  

4. **Novelty**  
   The combination of fractal self‑similarity scaling (iterated function systems on graph mappings), analogical structure‑mapping kernels, and Nash‑equilibrium refinement of mapping strategies is not present in existing pure‑algorithmic QA scorers. Prior work uses either graph‑kernel similarity or constraint satisfaction, but never treats mapping strategy selection as a game whose equilibrium determines the final score. Hence the approach is novel in this specific synthesis.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — The algorithm captures relational structure, propagates logical constraints, and refines scores via equilibrium reasoning, showing strong multi‑step reasoning.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — It implicitly evaluates confidence via mixed strategy weights but lacks explicit self‑monitoring of parsing failures.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — The method scores given answers; it does not generate new candidate hypotheses beyond the provided set.  
Implementability: 9/10 — All components rely on regex, NumPy matrix ops, and a small linear program solvable with stdlib‑compatible libraries; no external APIs or neural nets are needed.
