## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
We treat each candidate answer as an “arm” in a multi‑armed bandit that we evaluate iteratively. For every arm we build a tiny deterministic dynamical system whose state vector **x** ∈ {0,1}^P encodes the truth value of each proposition *p* extracted from the prompt and the answer (P = number of unique propositions).  

1. **Parsing & proposition extraction** – Using a handful of regex patterns we pull out:  
   * atomic predicates (e.g., “X is Y”),  
   * negations (`not`),  
   * comparatives (`>`, `<`, `≥`, `≤`),  
   * conditionals (`if … then …`),  
   * causal cues (`because`, `leads to`),  
   * numeric constants,  
   * ordering relations (`before`, `after`).  
   Each predicate becomes a dimension; its negation is handled by flipping the bit.

2. **State transition (deterministic rule)** – Given current **x**, we apply modus ponens and transitivity: for every extracted rule *antecedent → consequent* we set the consequent bit to 1 if all antecedent bits are 1. This yields a function **f**(**x**, answer). We iterate **x₀** (all premises true) → **x₁** = **f**(**x₀**) → … until a fixed point or a max of 10 steps.  

3. **Lyapunov‑style consistency score** – We approximate the Jacobian **J** of **f** by finite differences (perturb each bit, recompute **f**, divide by ε=1e‑6). The largest singular value σ_max(**J**) (computed with `numpy.linalg.svd`) gives an expansion factor per step. The finite‑time Lyapunov exponent λ = (1/T) Σₜ log σ_max(**Jₜ**). Lower (more negative) λ → higher consistency → score S_cons = –λ.

4. **Kolmogorov‑complexity proxy** – We serialize the answer’s proposition list as a short string (e.g., `"p1 & ¬p3 → p5"`). Using `zlib.compress` from the stdlib we obtain length L bytes. Simpler descriptions are favoured: S_comp = –L.

5. **Bandit‑driven evaluation** – For each answer *i* we keep pull count n_i and average reward r_i = (S_cons + S_comp)/2. The UCB index is  
   `UCB_i = r_i + c * sqrt(log(Σ n_k) / n_i)` with c=0.5.  
   At each iteration we select the arm with highest UCB, compute its two scores, update r_i and n_i. After a budget of 30 pulls we return the answer with the highest r_i as the final ranking.

**Structural features parsed** – negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal claims, numeric values, ordering relations (temporal or magnitude), and conjunctions/disjunctions implied by commas or “and/or”.

**Novelty** – Pure logical‑reasoning tools use constraint propagation; bandit‑based active learning appears in experimental design; Kolmogorov‑complexity is used for MDL model selection. Joining all three to score candidate answers via a dynamical‑system stability measure has not, to our knowledge, been combined in a single lightweight evaluator.

**Rating**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures consistency via Lyapunov exponent and logical propagation.  
Metacognition: 7/10 — bandit gives explicit explore/exploit but lacks deeper self‑reflection on its own uncertainty.  
Hypothesis generation: 6/10 — generates hypotheses only from supplied answer candidates; limited creative synthesis.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies solely on regex, numpy, and stdlib (zlib); no external dependencies.
