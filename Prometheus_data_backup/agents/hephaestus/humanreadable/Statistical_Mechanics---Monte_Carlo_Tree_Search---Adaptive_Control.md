## Nous Analysis

**1. Algorithm**  
We build a Monte‑Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) whose nodes represent *partial answer hypotheses*. Each node stores:  
- `state`: a tuple of extracted logical propositions (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric values, causal claims, ordering relations) that have been asserted so far.  
- `N`: visit count.  
- `Q`: average reward (negative energy) obtained from rollouts that passed through this node.  
- `P`: prior probability derived from a simple language model (e.g., word‑frequency smoothed with Laplace).  

Selection uses an adaptive UCB formula:  
```
select child argmax(Q_i + c_i * sqrt(log(N_parent) / N_i))
```
where the exploration constant `c_i` is updated online by an adaptive‑control rule:  
```
c_i ← c_i * (1 + η * (σ_i - σ_target))
```
`σ_i` is the empirical standard deviation of rewards observed from child `i`, `σ_target` is a desired variance (set to 0.1), and `η` is a small learning rate (0.01). This continuously tunes exploration to match observed uncertainty.

Expansion adds child nodes by applying one logical operation (e.g., inserting a missing comparative, flipping a negation, or grounding a numeric value) to the parent’s state, generating a new hypothesis.

Rollout (simulation) proceeds by randomly completing the partial state using a uniform policy over allowed operations, then evaluating the resulting full candidate answer. Evaluation treats each constraint extracted from the prompt as an *energy term*:  
- Violated negation → +E_neg  
- Violated comparative/ordering → +E_comp  
- Violated conditional (antecedent true, consequent false) → +E_cond  
- Violated causal claim (cause present, effect missing) → +E_cau  
- Numeric mismatch (value outside tolerated interval) → +E_num  

Total energy `E = Σ w_k * violation_k`. The reward is `R = -E`.  

Backpropagation updates `N` and `Q` of all nodes on the path with the observed `R`. After a fixed budget of simulations, the score for a complete candidate answer is the Boltzmann‑weighted average of its visit count:  
```
score(answer) = exp(-β * E_answer) / Z_approx
```
where `Z_approx` is approximated by the sum of `exp(-β * E)` over all leaf nodes visited during the search (i.e., a Monte‑Carlo estimate of the partition function). β is set to 1.0 for simplicity.

**2. Structural features parsed**  
The prompt is scanned with regex patterns to extract:  
- Negations (`not`, `no`, `never`).  
- Comparatives and ordering (`greater than`, `less than`, `≤`, `≥`, `more … than`).  
- Conditionals (`if … then`, `unless`, `provided that`).  
- Numeric values and units (`[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?\s*(kg|m|s|%)`).  
- Causal claims (`because`, `due to`, `leads to`, `results in`).  
- Explicit ordering relations (`first`, `second`, `finally`, `before`, `after`).  

These become propositional atoms that feed the constraint‑energy terms.

**3. Novelty**  
MCTS has been applied to theorem proving and game playing; energy‑based scoring appears in statistical‑physics‑inspired NLP models; adaptive UCB tuning appears in bandit literature. The specific combination — using a Boltzmann‑weighted partition function estimated via MCTS, with online adaptive control of the exploration constant to handle uncertainty in constraint violations — is not documented in existing QA or reasoning‑evaluation work, making the approach novel.

**4. Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure via constraint energy and propagates it through tree search.  
Metacognition: 7/10 — adaptive UCB provides self‑regulation of exploration based observed variance.  
Hypothesis generation: 8/10 — MCTS systematically expands answer hypotheses guided by priors and rollouts.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on numpy for numeric ops and Python’s re/stdlib for parsing and tree structures.
