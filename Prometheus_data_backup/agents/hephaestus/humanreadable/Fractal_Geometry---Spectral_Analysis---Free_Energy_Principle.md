## Nous Analysis

The algorithm builds a multi‑scale logical‑graph of each answer, extracts its spectral signature, and scores it by a variational free‑energy proxy.  

1. **Parsing & graph construction** – Using only the standard library, the prompt and each candidate answer are tokenized (whitespace/punctuation split). Regex patterns extract elementary logical atoms: negations (“not”, “no”), comparatives (“greater than”, “less than”), conditionals (“if … then …”), causal markers (“because”, “leads to”), numeric values, and ordering relations (“first”, “second”). Each atom becomes a node; directed edges are added when two atoms appear in the same clause with a connective that preserves direction (e.g., “X causes Y” → edge X→Y). The resulting structure is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that can be viewed as a hierarchical, self‑similar layout: sub‑graphs corresponding to clauses repeat at different depths, giving a fractal‑like topology.  

2. **Fractal descriptor** – The DAG is converted to an adjacency matrix A (numpy array). For a series of box sizes ε = 2⁻ᵏ (k=0…K), we cover the node set with boxes of radius ε in graph‑distance metric and count N(ε) occupied boxes. The slope of log N(ε) vs. log (1/ε) estimated by numpy.polyfit yields an approximate Hausdorff dimension D̂, a scalar fractal feature.  

3. **Spectral descriptor** – The depth‑wise node count vector v (number of nodes at each graph depth) is treated as a discrete signal. Its power spectral density is computed via numpy.fft.rfft(v); the magnitude squared|FFT|² is normalized to a probability distribution p(freq). Spectral features include the peak frequency, spectral entropy −∑p log p, and bandwidth (frequency range containing 90 % of power).  

4. **Free‑energy scoring** – A simple generative prior assumes answers should exhibit low spectral entropy (predictable structure) and a fractal dimension near a target D₀ (e.g., 1.5 for moderately self‑similar reasoning). The variational free energy F is approximated as:  
   F = ½‖p_obs – p_prior‖² + λ·|D̂ − D₀|,  
   where p_prior is a fixed low‑entropy spectral template (e.g., a Gaussian centered at 0 Hz) and λ balances complexity vs. prediction error. Lower F indicates a better answer; scores are transformed to a 0‑1 range via score = exp(−F).  

**Structural features parsed**: negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal claims, numeric values, ordering relations, and the hierarchical nesting of these constructs (clauses within clauses).  

**Novelty**: While fractal dimension, spectral analysis, and predictive‑coding/free‑energy frameworks each appear separately in cognitive‑science and signal‑processing literature, their joint application to parse logical‑graph structure of text and compute a variational free‑energy score for answer ranking is not documented in existing NLP evaluation tools.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — combines logical graph parsing with multi‑scale spectral and fractal measures to capture both symbolic and statistical aspects of reasoning.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the method can estimate its own uncertainty via spectral entropy but lacks explicit self‑monitoring of parsing failures.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — generates hypotheses implicitly (spectral peaks, fractal dimension) but does not propose alternative explanations or revise parses.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex, numpy linear algebra, and FFT; all components are straightforward to code and run without external dependencies.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Fractal Geometry**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Spectral Analysis**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Free Energy Principle**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 35% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.

- Fractal Geometry + Free Energy Principle: strong positive synergy (+0.474). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.
- Free Energy Principle + Spectral Analysis: negative interaction (-0.089). Keep these concepts in separate code paths to avoid interference.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Fractal Geometry + Cellular Automata + Free Energy Principle (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Fractal Geometry + Chaos Theory + Free Energy Principle (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Fractal Geometry + Differentiable Programming + Free Energy Principle (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
