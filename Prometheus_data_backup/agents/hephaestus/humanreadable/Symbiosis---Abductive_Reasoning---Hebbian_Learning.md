## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
1. **Parsing** – Tokenize the prompt and each candidate answer into sentences. Using a handful of regex patterns, extract propositional tuples:  
   - *Negation*: `\b(not|no|never)\b\s+(\w+)` → `(¬, predicate)`  
   - *Comparative*: `(\w+)\s+(more|less|greater|smaller)\s+than\s+(\w+|\d+)` → `(>, <, predicate, value)`  
   - *Conditional*: `if\s+(.+?)\s+then\s+(.+)` → `(antecedent → consequent)`  
   - *Causal*: `(.+?)\s+(because|due to|leads to|results in)\s+(.+)` → `(cause → effect)`  
   - *Numeric*: `\d+(\.\d+)?` → `(value)`  
   - *Ordering*: `\b(before|after|first|second|last)\b` → `(order relation)`  
   Each tuple becomes a **node** with fields `{type, polarity, arguments}`.  

2. **Graph construction** – Create a directed bipartite graph **G = (P ∪ C, E)** where **P** are prompt nodes, **C** are candidate‑answer nodes. Initialize edge weight `w_ij = 0`.  

3. **Hebbian update** – For each co‑occurrence of a prompt node *p* and a candidate node *c* in the same sentence (or within a sliding window of 3 tokens), increase the weight:  
   `w_ij ← w_ij + η * act(p) * act(c)` where `act(x)=1` if the node appears, `η=0.1`.  

4. **Symbiosis (mutual‑benefit constraint propagation)** –  
   - If *p* and *c* share the same polarity (both positive or both negated) and their arguments unify, add a **mutual benefit** term: `w_ij ← w_ij + β` (`β=0.2`).  
   - If polarity conflicts (one positive, the other negated) and arguments unify, apply a **penalty**: `w_ij ← w_ij - γ` (`γ=0.3`).  
   - Propagate updates iteratively (max 5 rounds) using transitive closure: for any path *p → x → c*, adjust `w_pc` by `λ * min(w_px, w_xc)` (`λ=0.05`).  

5. **Abductive scoring** – For each candidate answer *c*, compute its explanation score:  
   `S(c) = Σ_{p∈P} w_{pc} * relevance(p)` where `relevance(p)=1` for all extracted prompt nodes (could be weighted by information content, e.g., rarer predicates get higher weight).  
   Normalize scores across candidates and select the candidate with maximal `S(c)`.  

**Structural features parsed** – negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal claims, numeric values, ordering relations. These are the only syntactic constructs the algorithm relies on; all other text is ignored for scoring.  

**Novelty** – Purely symbolic Hebbian weight updates combined with constraint‑propagation‑based mutual benefit and an abductive‑style aggregation are not standard in existing rule‑based QA systems. Related work uses neural embeddings or Markov Logic Networks; this approach stays within numpy/stdlib while mimicking Hebbian learning as a similarity update.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 7/10 — captures explanatory strength via weighted graph but lacks deep logical inference beyond simple unification.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — no explicit monitoring of confidence or error detection; scoring is static after propagation.  
Hypothesis generation: 8/10 — edge weights act as generated hypotheses about prompt‑answer compatibility, updated via Hebbian symbiosis.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex, numpy arrays for weight matrix, and basic loops; readily producible in <200 lines.
