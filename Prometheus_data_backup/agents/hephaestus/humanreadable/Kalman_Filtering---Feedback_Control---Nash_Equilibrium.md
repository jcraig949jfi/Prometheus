## Nous Analysis

The algorithm treats each candidate answer as a noisy observation of an underlying “correctness state” that evolves over the set of propositions extracted from the answer.  

**Data structures**  
- `props`: list of dicts, one per extracted proposition. Each dict contains `type` (atomic, comparative, conditional, causal, numeric), `polarity` (±1 for negation), `variables` (entity names), `value` (float if numeric), and `links` (list of indices of propositions it logically depends on).  
- State vector `x ∈ ℝⁿ` where `n = len(props)` holds the current belief (probability) that each proposition is true.  
- Covariance matrix `P ∈ ℝⁿˣⁿ` representing uncertainty of those beliefs.  
- Measurement vector `z ∈ ℝᵐ` where each element is the binary output of a lightweight rubric (e.g., “does the answer contain a correct causal link?”).  
- Measurement matrix `H ∈ ℝᵐˣⁿ` maps propositions to rubric items (1 if the proposition directly satisfies the item, else 0).  

**Operations**  
1. **Prediction** – Assuming propositions are static over the short scoring horizon, set `F = I`, so `x_pred = F x` and `P_pred = F P Fᵀ + Q` (with small process noise `Q`).  
2. **Update (Kalman)** – Compute innovation `y = z - H x_pred`. Compute Kalman gain `K = P_pred Hᵀ (H P_pred Hᵀ + R)⁻¹`. Update belief: `x = x_pred + K y`, `P = (I - K H) P_pred`.  
3. **Feedback control on measurement noise** – Let `e = y` (the residual). Adjust the measurement noise covariance `R` with a PID controller:  
   `R_{k+1} = R_k + Kp·e + Ki·∑e + Kd·(e - e_{prev})`.  
   This makes the filter trust the rubric more when residuals are small and less when they systematically deviate, mimicking a control loop that stabilizes estimation.  
4. **Nash equilibrium aggregation** – After processing all candidates, build a payoff matrix `U` where `U[i,j] = -|score_i - target_j|` (target_j is a reference score from a gold answer). Compute the mixed‑strategy Nash equilibrium via simple fictitious play (iterative best‑response) using only numpy; the equilibrium strategy `π` gives a weight for each candidate. The final score for answer *i* is `∑_j π_j·score_{i,j}`.  

**Structural features parsed**  
- Negations (`not`, `no`).  
- Comparatives (`greater than`, `less than`, `–er`).  
- Conditionals (`if … then`, `unless`).  
- Causal claims (`because`, `leads to`, `results in`).  
- Numeric values and units.  
- Ordering relations (`first`, `second`, `before`, `after`).  
- Quantifiers (`all`, `some`, `none`).  

**Novelty**  
The trio has not been combined in existing scoring tools. Kalman filtering provides recursive belief updating; the feedback‑control layer adapts trust in heuristic rubrics, a technique absent from standard Bayesian truth‑serum approaches; and the Nash‑equilibrium step treats multiple answers as strategic agents, yielding a stable aggregate score that resists gaming. While each component appears separately in literature, their integrated use for answer scoring is novel.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure via propositional extraction and belief propagation.  
Metacognition: 7/10 — PID‑adjusted noise gives the system a self‑monitoring loop that recalibrates trust in its own heuristics.  
Hypothesis generation: 6/10 — limited to re‑weighting existing propositions; does not invent new factual content.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on numpy for matrix ops and stdlib for parsing; no external libraries or APIs needed.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Kalman Filtering**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Feedback Control**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 


Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Kalman Filtering + Falsificationism + Nash Equilibrium (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Attention Mechanisms + Neural Plasticity + Feedback Control (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Chaos Theory + Cognitive Load Theory + Kalman Filtering (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
