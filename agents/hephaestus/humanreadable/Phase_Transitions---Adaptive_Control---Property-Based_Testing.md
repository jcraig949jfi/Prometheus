## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
The scorer is a Python class `AdaptivePhaseScorer`. Its internal state consists of:  

1. **Constraint list** `C = [c₁,…,cₙ]` where each `cᵢ` is a tuple `(type, args, func)`.  
   - `type` ∈ {`EQ`, `LT`, `GT`, `NOT`, `IMPLY`, `CAUSAL`}.  
   - `args` are indices into a token‑value vector `v` extracted from the candidate answer (numbers, entity IDs, polarity flags).  
   - `func` is a numpy‑based predicate returning 0/1 (hard) or a float in [0,1] (soft) indicating satisfaction.  

2. **Slack vector** `s = [s₁,…,sₙ]` (one per numeric constraint) initialized to zeros.  

3. **PI controller parameters** `Kp, Ki` and target score band `[τ_low, τ_high]`.  

**Parsing** (regex‑based, stdlib only):  
- Extract numeric constants (`\d+(\.\d+)?`) → assign to `v`.  
- Detect comparatives (`greater than`, `less than`, `at least`) → create `LT/GT` constraints.  
- Detect conditionals (`if … then …`) → `IMPLY`.  
- Detect negations (`not`, `no`) → `NOT`.  
- Detect causal cue words (`because`, `leads to`) → `CAUSAL`.  
- Build a directed graph of variables for transitivity closure (Floyd‑Warshall on boolean matrix).  

**Constraint propagation**:  
- Topologically order the graph; for each node apply modus ponens on `IMPLY` nodes and update truth values.  
- Apply transitivity: if `a LT b` and `b LT c` infer `a LT c`.  
- For each constraint compute satisfaction `ϕᵢ = func(v, sᵢ)`.  

**Score**: `score = mean(ϕᵢ)`.  

**Phase‑transition detection**:  
- Define a scalar slack multiplier `α ≥ 0`; actual slack for constraint i is `α·sᵢ`.  
- Sweep `α` from 0 to `α_max` (e.g., 5) in steps, compute `score(α)`.  
- Use `np.gradient` to find where `|d score/d α|` exceeds a threshold → critical `α*`.  

**Adaptive control (online)**:  
- After each candidate, compute error `e = τ_target – score` where `τ_target = (τ_low+τ_high)/2`.  
- Update integral `I += e`.  
- Adjust slack multiplier: `α ← α + Kp·e + Ki·I`, clipped to `[0, α_max]`.  

**Property‑based testing (shrinking)**:  
- Generate mutants of the candidate by: (a) adding Gaussian noise to numeric tokens, (b) flipping polarity flags, (c) swapping synonyms from a predefined list.  
- Evaluate each mutant; keep those with score < `τ_low`.  
- Apply shrinking: repeatedly halve perturbations until score rises above `τ_low`; the last failing mutant is the minimal counterexample, used to increase `α` for the next iteration.  

All operations rely on `numpy` for vectorized arithmetic and Python’s `re`, `itertools`, `random` for parsing and mutation.

Reasoning: 7/10 — The algorithm captures logical structure and detects abrupt quality shifts, but relies on hand‑crafted regex patterns that may miss complex linguistic phenomena.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — The PI controller provides simple online adaptation; however, it lacks higher‑order self‑reflection on why the controller is adjusting.  
Hypothesis generation: 8/10 — Property‑based mutant generation with shrinking systematically explores the input space to find minimal failing cases, akin to Hypothesis.  
Implementability: 9/10 — All components use only numpy and the standard library; the core loops are straightforward to code and debug.
