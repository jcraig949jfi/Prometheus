## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
We build a hybrid *Critical‑Feedback Regulatory Scorer* (CFRS).  
1. **Parsing layer** – From the prompt and each candidate answer we extract a directed labeled graph \(G=(V,E)\) where nodes are propositions (extracted via regex for negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal verbs, numeric thresholds) and edges are labeled relations:  
   - *supports* (↝), *contradicts* (↛), *implies* (→), *quantifies* (≈ value), *temporal* (before/after).  
   The adjacency matrix \(A\in\{-1,0,1\}^{n\times n}\) encodes support (+1), contradiction (‑1) and no relation (0).  
2. **Gene‑Regulatory core** – Treat each proposition as a gene with expression level \(x_i\in[0,1]\). Initialize \(x_i\) from a similarity heuristic (e.g., Jaccard of token sets) to give a prior activation. Update synchronously using a sigmoid‑based rule:  
   \[
   x_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma\Big(\sum_j A_{ij} x_j^{(t)} + b_i\Big),\qquad \sigma(z)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}
   \]  
   where \(b_i\) is a bias term set to 0.5 for neutral propositions. This captures attractor dynamics of GRNs.  
3. **Phase‑Transition detector** – Compute a global order parameter \(m = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i (2x_i-1)\) (magnetization‑like). As iterations proceed, monitor \(|m_t-m_{t-1}|\). When the change falls below a threshold \(\epsilon\) we deem the system at a fixed point; the distance to the critical point is approximated by the susceptibility \(\chi = \frac{\partial m}{\partial h}\big|_{h=0}\) estimated via a small perturbation \(h\) added to all \(b_i\). High \(\chi\) indicates proximity to a phase transition, i.e., the answer is poised between coherent and incoherent regimes.  
4. **Feedback‑Control correction** – Define error \(e = r - m\) where \(r\) is a target order parameter (e.g., 0.8 for a strongly supported answer). Update biases with a discrete PID:  
   \[
   b_i^{(t+1)} = b_i^{(t)} + K_p e_t + K_i\sum_{k=0}^{t} e_k + K_d (e_t-e_{t-1})
   \]  
   Gains \(K_p,K_i,K_d\) are fixed (e.g., 0.2,0.05,0.1). After a fixed number of iterations (or convergence), the final score for a candidate is \(s = \frac{1+m}{2}\in[0,1]\). Higher \(s\) means the answer sits in the stable, high‑support attractor region.

**Structural features parsed**  
- Negations (flip edge sign), comparatives (“greater than”, “less than”), conditionals (“if … then”), causal verbs (“causes”, “leads to”), numeric thresholds (attached to *quantifies* edges), ordering relations (“before”, “after”), and explicit support/contradiction cue words (“because”, “however”).  

**Novelty**  
The trio of concepts is not combined in existing NLP scorers. GRN‑style attractor dynamics have been used for semantic similarity, phase‑transition metrics appear in physics‑inspired NLP, and PID control is rare in scoring. Together they form a novel feedback‑regulated, critical‑point‑sensitive graph‑based reasoner.

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure and dynamics beyond surface similarity.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — limited self‑monitoring; relies on fixed gains.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — can propose attractor states but does not generate new hypotheses autonomously.  
Implementability: 9/10 — uses only numpy for matrix ops and stdlib for regex; straightforward to code.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Phase Transitions**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 33% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.
- **Gene Regulatory Networks**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Feedback Control**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Phase Transitions + Gene Regulatory Networks + Mechanism Design (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Attention Mechanisms + Neural Plasticity + Feedback Control (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Category Theory + Phase Transitions + Neural Architecture Search (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
