## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm: Dialectical‑Free‑Energy Constraint Solver (DFECS)**  

1. **Parsing & Data Structures**  
   - Tokenise the prompt and each candidate answer with a simple regex‑based tokenizer that preserves punctuation.  
   - Extract *propositional atoms* (noun phrases, verbs, adjectives) and attach *features*: polarity (negation), modality (must/might), comparative operators, numeric bounds, and causal markers (“because”, “leads to”).  
   - Store each atom as a node in a directed graph `G = (V, E)`. Edges represent logical relations extracted from the text:  
     * `→` for conditionals (if‑A then‑B),  
     * `↔` for biconditionals (iff),  
     * `¬` attached to a node for negation,  
     * `<`, `>`, `=` for comparatives,  
     * `≈` with a tolerance for numeric equality.  
   - Attach to each node a *belief vector* `b_i ∈ ℝ^k` (k = number of distinct feature dimensions) initialised to a uniform distribution (maximum‑entropy prior).  

2. **Constraint Propagation (Free Energy Minimisation)**  
   - For each edge, define a *potential* φ_e(b_i, b_j) = ½‖b_i – T_e b_j‖² where `T_e` encodes the relation (e.g., for `→`, `T_e` copies the antecedent’s belief to the consequent; for `¬`, flips polarity).  
   - The total variational free energy is `F = Σ_e φ_e + Σ_i H(b_i)` where `H` is the Shannon entropy of the belief vector (implemented via `-∑ b log b`).  
   - Iteratively update beliefs using gradient descent on `F` (equivalent to belief propagation in a factor graph) until ΔF < ε or a max‑iteration limit. All operations use only NumPy arrays.  

3. **Dialectical Scoring**  
   - After convergence, compute a *synthesis score* for each candidate answer:  
     `S = 1 – (F_answer / F_prompt)`.  
   - Lower free energy (better fit to constraints) yields higher `S`.  
   - Additionally, compute a *thesis‑antithesis tension* term: `T = |∑_{i∈Thesis} b_i – ∑_{j∈Antithesis} b_j|₁`.  
   - Final score = α·S – β·T (α,β tuned on a validation set).  

**Structural Features Parsed**  
- Negations (`not`, `no`), modality (`must`, `may`), comparatives (`more than`, `less than`), numeric values with units, ordering relations (`first`, `then`), causal connectives (`because`, `therefore`), and biconditionals (`if and only if`).  

**Novelty**  
The combination mirrors existing work on factor‑graph based natural‑language inference (e.g., Markov Logic Networks) and maximum‑entropy priors, but the explicit dialectical tension term and the use of free‑energy minimisation as a scoring function for answer selection are not standard in current lightweight reasoning tools.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical constraints and uncertainty well, though scalability to long texts remains untested.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the algorithm can monitor free‑energy reduction as a proxy for confidence, but lacks explicit self‑reflection loops.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — generates implicit hypotheses via belief vectors, yet does not produce explicit alternative explanations.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex parsing, NumPy linear algebra, and simple gradient loops; no external libraries needed.
