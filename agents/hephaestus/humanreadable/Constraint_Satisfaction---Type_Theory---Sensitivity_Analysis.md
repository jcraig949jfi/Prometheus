## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm:**  
We build a hybrid **Typed Constraint‑Propagation Solver with Sensitivity‑Weighted Scoring**.  

1. **Parsing & Typing (Type Theory)**  
   - Tokenise the prompt and each candidate answer.  
   - Assign each extracted proposition a *type* from a finite schema: `Bool` (truth‑valued statements), `Real` (numeric quantities), `Order` (≤, ≥, <, >), `Cause` (X → Y), `Neg` (¬), `Comp` (comparative).  
   - Store propositions as nodes in a typed directed hypergraph `G = (V, E, τ)` where `τ: V → Type`. Edges encode logical relations:  
     * `modus ponens`: `(P → Q, P) → Q`  
     * `transitivity` for `Order`: `(a ≤ b, b ≤ c) → a ≤ c`  
     * `contraposition` for `Cause`: `(X → Y) → (¬Y → ¬X)`  

2. **Constraint Satisfaction Core**  
   - Initialise a domain for each variable: `Bool` → {True, False}; `Real` → interval extracted from numeric tokens (e.g., “between 5 and 12” → [5,12]); `Order` → partially ordered set; `Cause` → binary relation.  
   - Apply arc‑consistency (AC‑3) repeatedly: for each edge, prune values that violate the associated constraint (e.g., if `P → Q` and domain(P) excludes True, keep Q unrestricted; if domain(P) = {True} then enforce Q ∈ {True}).  
   - When a domain becomes empty, the candidate is **inconsistent** → score 0.  

3. **Sensitivity‑Weighted Scoring**  
   - For each variable, compute a *sensitivity coefficient* `s_i = (width of final domain) / (width of initial domain)`.  
   - The overall consistency score is `S = ∏_i (1 - s_i)`, penalising answers that leave large uncertain intervals (i.e., low robustness to input perturbations).  
   - If all domains are singletons (`s_i = 0`), `S = 1`.  
   - Final answer score = `S` (range [0,1]), higher means more deterministically supported and robust.  

**Structural Features Parsed:**  
- Negations (`not`, `no`, `never`) → `Neg` type, flips Boolean domains.  
- Comparatives (`more than`, `less than`, `at least`) → `Order` type, generates inequality constraints.  
- Conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`) → `Cause` type, creates implication edges.  
- Numeric values and ranges → `Real` type, initialises intervals.  
- Causal claims (`X leads to Y`, `because`) → `Cause` type with directionality.  
- Ordering relations (`first`, `last`, `before`, `after`) → `Order` type, yields transitive constraints.  

**Novelty:**  
While constraint satisfaction and type‑theoretic parsing appear separately in semantic parsers and SAT‑based QA, coupling them with a sensitivity analysis that quantifies domain robustness is not standard in existing reasoning‑evaluation tools. The closest precedents are probabilistic soft logic (which blends weights with constraints) and dependent type checking in proof assistants, but none propagate interval sensitivities to score answer robustness. Hence the combination is novel for lightweight, numpy‑only evaluation.  

**Ratings:**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure, propagates constraints, and quantifies robustness via sensitivity.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the method can detect over‑unspecified answers but does not explicitly model the model’s own uncertainty about its parsing.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — generates implied consequences (via forward chaining) but does not propose novel hypotheses beyond those entailed.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex‑based token extraction, numpy arrays for intervals, and standard library data structures; no external dependencies.

### Scores

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Reasoning | 8/10 |
| Metacognition | 6/10 |
| Hypothesis Generation | 5/10 |

**Novelty**: novel

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Type Theory**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 

- Constraint Satisfaction + Type Theory: strong positive synergy (+0.448). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Constraint Satisfaction + Spectral Analysis + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Active Inference + Mechanism Design + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Analogical Reasoning + Pragmatism + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
