## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
1. **Parsing & Proposition Extraction** – Apply a fixed set of regex patterns to the prompt and each candidate answer to pull out atomic propositions:  
   - Negations (`\bnot\b`, `\bno\b`) → flag `¬p`.  
   - Conditionals (`\bif\s+(.+?)\s+then\b`) → edge `p → q`.  
   - Comparatives (`\bmore\s+than\b`, `\bless\s+than\b`) → ordered relation `p > q` or `p < q`.  
   - Numerics (`\b\d+(\.\d+)?\b`) → numeric atom `n`.  
   - Causals (`\bbecause\b`, `\bcause\b`) → edge `cause → effect`.  
   Each proposition gets an integer ID; we store them in a list `props`.  

2. **Constraint Graph** – Build a Boolean adjacency matrix `A ∈ {0,1}^{n×n}` where `A[i,j]=1` iff proposition *i* implies *j* (from conditionals, causals, transitivity of comparatives).  

3. **Autopoietic Closure (Iterative Propagation)** – Initialize a truth vector `t₀` where facts directly asserted in the prompt are 1, negated facts are 0, and all others are 0.5 (unknown). Iterate:  
   ```
   t_{k+1} = clip(t_k + α * (A @ t_k), 0, 1)
   ```  
   with small step `α=0.1`. Stop when `‖t_{k+1}-t_k‖₂ < 1e‑3` or after 20 steps. The fixed point `t*` is the self‑produced organization (autopoiesis).  

4. **Phase‑Transition Order Parameter** – Define the order parameter `φ = mean(t*)` (fraction of propositions held true). Introduce a “temperature‑like” λ controlling an entropy term:  
   ```
   F(λ) = -Σ log(t*_i + ε) + λ * H(t*)
   ```  
   where `H(p) = -Σ[p log p + (1-p) log(1-p)]` is binary entropy, ε=1e‑9. Sweep λ ∈ [0,2] in 0.05 steps, compute `F(λ)`, and locate λ* where `|dF/dλ|` is maximal (numerical derivative). The distance `|λ* - λ₀|` (λ₀ set from prompt complexity, e.g., number of conditionals) yields a phase‑transition score `S_pt = 1 - normalized distance`.  

5. **Pragmatic Maxim Scores** (using only numpy & stdlib):  
   - **Quantity** – `S_q = 1 - |len(candidate) - L_ideal|/L_ideal`, where `L_ideal` is median length of prompt propositions.  
   - **Relevance** – TF‑IDF vectors built from prompt propositions and candidate; cosine similarity `S_r`.  
   - **Manner** – Count of hedge/vague words (`maybe`, `perhaps`, `about`); `S_m = 1 - min(count/5,1)`.  
   - **Quality** – Proportion of propositions in candidate whose truth value in `t*` is <0.3; `S_qlt = 1 - that proportion`.  
   Pragmatic score `S_prag = (S_q + S_r + S_m + S_qlt)/4`.  

6. **Final Score** –  
   ```
   Score = w₁*S_pt + w₂*S_prag
   ```  
   with `w₁=0.6, w₂=0.4`. All operations use numpy arrays; no external models.

**Structural Features Parsed**  
Negations, conditionals, comparatives, numeric values, causal claims, ordering relations (>, <, ≥, ≤), and explicit truth‑affirming statements.

**Novelty**  
Constraint‑propagation solvers exist (e.g., LogicNets) and pragmatic scorers (e.g., GRICA) have been proposed, but none combine an autopoietic fixed‑point loop with a phase‑transition detection mechanism to identify a critical point of belief consolidation. This triadic coupling is not documented in current QA‑scoring literature, making the approach novel.

**Rating**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure and critical‑point dynamics but relies on hand‑crafted regex and linear approximations.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the system can monitor its own fixed point but lacks explicit self‑reflection on reasoning strategies.  
Hypothesis generation: 7/10 — closure step derives implicit propositions, acting as hypothesis generation, though limited to graph‑reachable ideas.  
Implementability: 9/10 — uses only numpy and the Python standard library; all steps are straightforward to code and run efficiently.
