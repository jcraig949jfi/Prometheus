## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm – Renormalized Holographic Epistemic Scorer (RHE‑Score)**  

1. **Data structures**  
   - `props`: list of atomic propositions extracted from the prompt and each candidate answer (strings).  
   - `prop_vec`: binary numpy array of shape `(n_props, n_features)` where each column encodes a structural feature (negation, comparative, conditional, causal cue, numeric value, ordering relation). Feature extraction uses deterministic regexes; e.g., `r'\bnot\b|\bno\b'` → negation column, `r'\bif\b.*\bthen\b'` → conditional column, `r'\bmore\b|\bless\b|\b>\b|\b<\b'` → comparative/ordering column, `r'\bcause\b|\bleads to\b|\bresults in\b'` → causal column, `r'\d+(\.\d+)?'` → numeric column.  
   - `Adj`: `(n_props, n_props)` implication matrix; `Adj[i,j]=1` if proposition *i* syntactically entails *j* (detected via rule‑based patterns: conditional → antecedent→consequent, causal → cause→effect, ordering → `<`/`>`).  
   - `belief`: numpy vector of shape `(n_props,)` representing current degree of justification for each proposition. Initialized from source reliability (e.g., premise = 1.0, candidate = 0.5).  
   - `justif`: numpy vector of shape `(n_props,)` epistemic weight combining foundational support (incoming edges from premises) and coherence (mutual support).  

2. **Operations (iterative renormalization)**  
   - **Coarsening step**: cluster propositions whose feature vectors have cosine similarity > τ (τ=0.8) using a simple greedy algorithm; replace each cluster by a super‑node whose feature vector is the mean of members and whose adjacency is the logical OR of internal edges.  
   - **Belief update** (epistemic propagation):  
     ```
     belief_new = np.clip(Adj.T @ belief, 0, 1)   # modus ponens / transitivity
     belief_new = belief_new * justif             # reliabilism weighting
     ```  
   - **Fixed‑point test**: stop when `np.linalg.norm(belief_new - belief) < 1e-3` or after 10 iterations. The resulting `belief` is the renormalized, scale‑independent justification distribution.  

3. **Holographic boundary extraction**  
   - Compute node degree `deg = Adj.sum(axis=1) + Adj.T.sum(axis=1)`.  
   - Define boundary set `B = {i | deg[i] > np.percentile(deg, 75)}` (the most connected propositions, analogous to the holographic screen).  
   - Boundary justification vector `J_boundary = belief[B]`.  

4. **Scoring logic**  
   - For each candidate answer, build its proposition sub‑vector `cand_vec` (same feature space).  
   - Project onto boundary: `score = np.dot(cand_vec[B], J_boundary) / (np.linalg.norm(cand_vec[B]) * np.linalg.norm(J_boundary) + 1e-8)`.  
   - Score ∈ [0,1]; higher means the candidate aligns with the renormalized, holographically compressed epistemic structure of the prompt.  

**Parsed structural features** – negations (`not`, `no`), comparatives (`more`, `less`, `>`, `<`), conditionals (`if … then`), causal cues (`cause`, `leads to`), numeric values (any decimal/integer), ordering relations (`greater than`, `less than`, `precedes`). These are turned into binary feature columns that drive proposition extraction and adjacency construction.  

**Novelty** – The combination is not a direct replica of existing work. Renormalization group ideas have been used in hierarchical clustering of concepts, holographic boundary reduction appears in graph‑summarization techniques, and epistemic weighting mirrors argumentation frameworks (e.g., ASPIC+). However, tightly coupling multi‑scale renormalization, a holographic screen derived from graph centrality, and a three‑part epistemic justification (foundational, coherent, reliable) into a single iterative scoring loop is, to the best of my knowledge, novel for answer‑scoring tools.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures multi‑scale logical structure and constraint propagation, but relies on hand‑crafted rules rather than learned inference.  
Metacognition: 7/10 — includes self‑consistency checks (fixed‑point) and reliability weighting, yet lacks explicit reflection on its own uncertainty.  
Hypothesis generation: 6/10 — can propose new justified propositions via belief propagation, but does not actively rank alternative hypotheses beyond the given candidates.  
Implementability: 9/10 — uses only numpy and regex; all steps are deterministic, O(n²) at worst, and straightforward to code.
