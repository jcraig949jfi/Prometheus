## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
We treat each candidate answer as a chromosome in a genetic algorithm. A chromosome stores:  

1. **Proposition set** `P` – a list of atomic propositions extracted from the answer text (see §2). Each proposition is a tuple `(pred, args, polarity)` where `polarity ∈ {+1,‑1}` encodes negation.  
2. **Description length** `L` – an upper bound on Kolmogorov complexity computed with a simple LZ77‑style estimator: `L = len(compressed_bytes)` using `zlib.compress` on the UTF‑8 bytes of the proposition list.  
3. **Fitness** `F = –(α·I + β·L)` where `I` is the number of violated constraints after propagation (see below) and `α,β` are fixed weights (e.g., α=1.0, β=0.1).  

**Operations per generation**  

- **Parsing** – Apply a handful of regexes to the raw answer string to extract:  
  * Negations (`not`, `no`, `n't`) → flip polarity.  
  * Comparatives (`>`, `<`, `≥`, `≤`, `more than`, `less than`).  
  * Conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`).  
  * Causal markers (`because`, `leads to`, `causes`).  
  * Ordering/temporal (`before`, `after`, `while`).  
  * Numeric values with units (`\d+(\.\d+)?\s*(km|h|%|…)`).  
  Each match yields a proposition added to `P`.  

- **Constraint propagation** – Build a directed graph where nodes are propositions and edges represent logical relations (e.g., `A → B` for conditionals, `A ∧ B → C` for conjunctive causal claims). Run a deterministic closure algorithm: repeatedly apply unit resolution, transitivity (`A→B, B→C ⇒ A→C`), and modus ponens until no new propositions are added. Count inconsistencies `I` as the number of times both a proposition and its negation appear in the closure.  

- **Selection, crossover, mutation** – Standard roulette‑wheel selection based on `F`. Crossover splices proposition lists from two parents; mutation randomly flips polarity, inserts/deletes a proposition, or perturbs a numeric value.  

- **Ergodic averaging** – After `G` generations (e.g., 50), compute the time‑average fitness `\bar{F} = (1/G) Σ_{t=1}^G F_t`. By the ergodic theorem for the Markov chain induced by selection/mutation, `\bar{F}` converges to the expected fitness of the stationary distribution, providing a stable score.  

The final score for an answer is `\bar{F}` (higher = better).  

**Structural features parsed** – negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal claims, ordering/temporal relations, numeric values with units, and conjunctions implicit in multi‑clause sentences.  

**Novelty** – The approach blends three well‑known ideas: (1) constraint‑propagation solvers (e.g., Markov Logic Networks), (2) genetic optimization of description length (related to Minimum Description Length MDL but with an evolutionary search), and (3) ergodic averaging to estimate expected fitness. While each component exists separately, their tight integration—using GA to minimize Kolmogorov‑complexity‑like penalty while enforcing logical consistency via propagation and scoring by time‑averaged fitness—has not been described in the literature to my knowledge, making the combination novel.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 7/10 — captures logical consistency and compressibility but relies on hand‑crafted regexes.  
Metacognition: 5/10 — no explicit self‑monitoring of search dynamics beyond fitness averaging.  
Hypothesis generation: 6/10 — mutation creates new proposition combinations, yet guided search is limited.  
Implementability: 8/10 — uses only `numpy` (for array ops) and stdlib (`re`, `zlib`, `random`).

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Ergodic Theory**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 37% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Kolmogorov Complexity**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 

- Ergodic Theory + Genetic Algorithms: strong positive synergy (+0.165). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Ergodic Theory + Genetic Algorithms + Analogical Reasoning (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Active Inference + Kolmogorov Complexity + Free Energy Principle (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Category Theory + Ergodic Theory + Metacognition (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
