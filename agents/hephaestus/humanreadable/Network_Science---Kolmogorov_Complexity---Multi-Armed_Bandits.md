## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm: Graph‑MDL Bandit Scorer (GMBS)**  

1. **Data structures**  
   - `nodes`: dict mapping each extracted entity (noun phrase, numeric token) to an integer ID.  
   - `edges`: list of tuples `(src_id, dst_id, rel_type, weight)` where `rel_type` ∈ {`negation`, `comparative`, `conditional`, `causal`, `order`, `equality`}.  
   - `candidates`: list of answer strings; each gets a node‑subgraph `G_i` induced by the entities and relations that appear in that answer.  
   - Bandit state per candidate: `pulls[i]` (integer), `reward[i]` (float), `UCB[i]` (float).  

2. **Parsing & graph construction** (uses only `re` and string ops)  
   - Regex patterns capture:  
     * Negations: `\bnot\b|\bn’t\b` → edge type `negation`.  
     * Comparatives: `\b(more|less|greater|fewer|higher|lower)\b` → `comparative`.  
     * Conditionals: `if\s+(.+?),\s+then\s+(.+)` → `conditional`.  
     * Numeric values: `\d+(\.\d+)?` → node with attribute `value`.  
     * Causal claims: `\b(causes?|leads? to|results? in)\b` → `causal`.  
     * Ordering: `\b(before|after|precedes?|follows?)\b` → `order`.  
   - Each matched triple (subject, relation, object) creates two nodes (if new) and a directed edge with weight = 1.  

3. **Kolmogorov‑complexity approximation (MDL)**  
   - For each candidate subgraph `G_i`, compute a description length `L_i` = `|V_i|·log|V| + |E_i|·log|E| + Σ log weight_e`.  
   - This is the length of a two‑part code: first encode the adjacency list (node IDs, edge types), then encode edge weights. Smaller `L_i` means the answer is more compressible given the global graph, i.e., it aligns better with the extracted logical structure.  

4. **Multi‑armed bandit scoring**  
   - Initialise each candidate with one pull, reward = `-L_i` (negative description length).  
   - For each iteration (up to a fixed budget, e.g., 20 pulls):  
     * Compute UCB_i = reward_i/pulls_i + √(2·log total_pulls / pulls_i).  
     * Select arm with highest UCB, pull it: re‑evaluate its reward as the average of `-L_i` over all pulls (the `-L_i` is deterministic, so reward stays `-L_i`).  
   - Final score for candidate i = `-L_i` (the MDL term); the bandit merely ensures we allocate evaluation effort to promising answers first, mimicking an explore‑exploit strategy without neural nets.  

**Structural features parsed** – negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric values, causal claims, ordering relations (and implicit equalities via co‑reference).  

**Novelty** – Graph‑based semantic parsing and MDL model selection exist separately; bandits are used for active learning or hyper‑parameter search. Jointly using a graph‑derived MDL score as the bandit reward to rank reasoning answers is not described in the literature, making the combination novel.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure via graph and compressibility, rewarding answers that fit the extracted constraints.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the bandit provides a simple explore‑exploit meta‑control but does not model uncertainty about the parsing itself.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — the system generates hypotheses (answer scores) but does not propose new relational structures beyond those seen in the prompt.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex, adjacency lists, and basic arithmetic; all components run in pure Python with numpy/std‑lib.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Network Science**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 36% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.
- **Kolmogorov Complexity**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Multi-Armed Bandits**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 

- Multi-Armed Bandits + Network Science: strong positive synergy (+0.585). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Network Science + Multi-Armed Bandits + Maximum Entropy (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Statistical Mechanics + Network Science + Multi-Armed Bandits (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Active Inference + Epistemology + Network Science (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
