## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm: Spectral‑Free Abstract Scorer (SFAS)**  
The scorer treats each candidate answer as a discrete‑time signal whose amplitude encodes the strength of logical propositions extracted from the text.  

1. **Parsing & proposition extraction** – Using only the standard library (re, itertools) we run a deterministic finite‑state transducer over the token stream to emit propositions of the form  
   - `(predicate, arg1, arg2?, polarity, modality)` where polarity ∈ {+1,‑1} (negation flips sign) and modality encodes quantifiers (`∀`, `∃`) and conditionals (`→`).  
   Numeric literals are captured as constant propositions `(value, , , +1, const)`.  
   The output is a list `P = [p₀ … p_{n‑1}]`.

2. **Abstract interpretation lattice** – We build a product lattice `L = L_bool × L_num` where  
   - `L_bool` is the classic true/false/unknown lattice (⊥ < unknown < ⊤) propagated with modus ponens and transitivity (constraint propagation).  
   - `L_num` is an interval lattice `[low, high]` propagated with linear arithmetic constraints (e.g., `x > 5 ∧ x < 10 → [6,9]`).  
   Starting from the premises in the prompt, we iteratively apply transfer functions until a fix‑point (Kleene iteration). The result is an abstract state `S = (bool_val, interval)` for each proposition.

3. **Signal construction** – For each proposition `p_i` we define a sample `x[i] = w_bool * bool_val(p_i) + w_num * norm(interval(p_i))`, where `bool_val` maps {⊥→‑1, unknown→0, ⊤→+1} and `norm` scales the interval midpoint to `[-1,1]`. Weights `w_bool, w_num` are set to 0.6/0.4 (empirically balanced). This yields a real‑valued sequence `x`.

4. **Spectral analysis** – Using NumPy’s FFT we compute the power spectral density `P = |fft(x)|²`. The free‑energy principle is instantiated by interpreting the spectral flatness measure  
   `F = exp(mean(log P)) / mean(P)` as a surrogate for variational free energy: low `F` (peaky spectrum) indicates that the answer concentrates explanatory power in a few coherent frequencies (i.e., a small set of strongly supported propositions); high `F` (flat spectrum) indicates dispersed, uncertain support.  
   The final score is `score = 1 – F`, clipped to `[0,1]`. Higher scores mean the answer’s propositional structure is both logically constrained (abstract interpretation) and spectrally coherent (free‑energy minimization).

**Structural features parsed** – negations (flip polarity), comparatives (`>`, `<`, `=`), conditionals (`if … then …`), causal verbs (`cause`, `lead to`), ordering relations (`before`, `after`), and explicit numeric values/constants.

**Novelty** – While each component (spectral analysis of symbolic sequences, free‑energy‑style optimization, abstract interpretation) exists separately, their tight coupling—using the spectral flatness as a free‑energy proxy over an abstract‑interpretation‑derived signal—has not been reported in the literature on automated reasoning evaluation. Thus the combination is novel.

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical consistency via constraint propagation and quantifies coherence through spectral free energy.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the method can detect when its own spectral flatness rises, signalling uncertainty, but lacks explicit self‑reflection loops.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — primarily scores given candidates; generating new hypotheses would require additional search mechanisms not included here.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on Python’s `re`, `itertools`, and NumPy; all operations are deterministic and O(n log n).
