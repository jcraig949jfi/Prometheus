## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
We treat each candidate answer as a set of propositional “agents” that must coexist symbiontically: they receive benefit only when their propositions are jointly justified and logically consistent. The scoring mechanism is designed to be incentive‑compatible — agents gain no extra score by inserting unsupported claims.

1. **Data structures**  
   - `Proposition`: `{id, text, type, polarity, vars, numeric, justification_weight}`  
     *type* ∈ {FACT, NEGATION, COMPARATIVE, CONDITIONAL, CAUSAL}.  
   - `Graph`: adjacency list `edges[source_id] = set(target_id)` representing inferred implications (e.g., from conditionals).  
   - `Evidence cues`: dictionary mapping cue phrases (“because”, “studies show”, “data indicates”) to base justification weights.

2. **Operations**  
   - **Extraction** – Apply regex patterns to the answer text to pull out propositions, marking polarity (negation), comparatives (`>`, `<`, `‑er`), conditionals (`if … then`, `unless`), causal markers (`because`, leads to), and numeric expressions with units. Each proposition receives an initial `justification_weight` from matched evidence cues (default 0.1).  
   - **Constraint propagation** – Compute transitive closure of the implication graph (Floyd‑Warshall on the adjacency matrix limited to reachable nodes). For each derived proposition, add its weight to the source’s weight (modeling epistemic support).  
   - **Consistency check** – If a proposition and its negation are both marked true after propagation, flag a contradiction.  
   - **Scoring** – Let `S` be the sum of justification weights of all non‑contradictory propositions. Introduce a penalty term `P = λ * U`, where `U` is the count of propositions whose justification weight fell below a threshold τ (i.e., unsupported/added claims) and λ is a design parameter (e.g., 0.5). Final score = `S – P`. This rule is incentive‑compatible because adding an unsupported claim increases `U` and reduces the score, mirroring mechanism‑design truthfulness constraints.

3. **Structural features parsed**  
   - Negations (`not`, `no`, `never`).  
   - Comparatives (`more than`, `less than`, `‑er`, `>`, `<`).  
   - Conditionals (`if … then`, `unless`, `provided that`).  
   - Causal claims (`because`, `due to`, `leads to`, `results in`).  
   - Numeric values with units and arithmetic relations.  
   - Ordering/temporal relations (`earlier than`, `after`, `greater than or equal to`).  

4. **Novelty**  
   Pure argument‑graph or epistemic‑scoring models exist separately, and mechanism design is used in economics but not combined with textual proposition extraction. The symbiosis‑inspired mutual‑benefit constraint, epistemic weighting from cue‑based justification, and an incentive‑compatible penalty term constitute a novel integration for answer scoring.

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure and justification but relies on shallow cue‑based weights.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — limited self‑reflection; the model does not monitor its own uncertainty beyond contradiction detection.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — focuses on evaluating given hypotheses, not generating new ones.  
Implementability: 9/10 — uses only regex, numpy arrays for transitive closure, and std‑lib containers; straightforward to code.
