## Nous Analysis

The algorithm builds a typed directed graph G from each candidate answer, where nodes are atomic propositions extracted by regex (e.g., “X > Y”, “not Z”, “if A then B”). Edges are labeled with relation types drawn from a finite set R = {negation, implication, ordering, equality, conjunction, disjunction, causal}. According to category‑theoretic semantics, G is a small category whose objects are propositions and whose morphisms are the labeled edges; a functor F maps this category into a fixed‑dimensional vector space V (ℝᴰ) by assigning each node a reservoir state hᵥ ∈ ℝᴰ.

**Reservoir propagation.** For each node v in a topological order, compute  
hᵥ = tanh( Σ_{(u→v)∈E} T_{r(u→v)} hᵤ + bᵥ ),  
where T_r ∈ ℝᴰˣᴰ is a pre‑generated random matrix specific to relation r (e.g., T_neg = −I, T_imp = random orthogonal, T_ord = lower‑triangular with positive diagonal), and bᵥ is a small bias. The reservoir is echo‑state: the spectral radius of each T_r is < 1, guaranteeing fading memory and no training of T_r or bᵥ.

**Maximum‑entropy readout.** After propagation, aggregate the final states of all nodes designated as “answer anchors” (e.g., the main claim) into a feature vector φ = [mean(h), std(h), h₀, …] ∈ ℝᴷ. We learn a weight vector w ∈ ℝᴷ by solving the maximum‑entropy problem subject to empirical expectation constraints derived from a small set of labeled examples:  
E_{model}[φ_k] = E_{data}[φ_k] ∀k.  
Iterative scaling (GIS) updates w until convergence, yielding a log‑linear model p(y=1|φ) ∝ exp(w·φ). The score for a candidate answer is the log‑probability s = w·φ − log Z, where Z is the partition function approximated by a single‑sample Monte‑Carlo estimate using the reservoir’s dynamics.

**Parsed structural features.** The regex stage extracts: negations (“not”, “no”), comparatives (“greater than”, “less than”, “>”, “<”), conditionals (“if … then …”, “implies”), causal claims (“because”, “leads to”), ordering relations (“before”, “after”, “precedes”), numeric values and equality statements, and logical connectives (“and”, “or”). These become the edge labels R that drive the specific T_r matrices.

**Novelty.** While reservoir computing and maximum‑entropy models appear separately in echo‑state networks and MaxEnt classifiers, coupling them through a category‑theoretic functor that respects the syntactic‑semantic graph of text is not documented in the literature. Existing neuro‑symbolic hybrids train both encoder and readout; here the encoder is fixed, random, and structurally grounded, making the approach distinct.

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 7/10 — captures logical structure via functorial propagation and principled uncertainty handling.  
Metacognition: 5/10 — limited self‑reflection; the model does not explicitly monitor its own uncertainty beyond the MaxEnt variance.  
Hypothesis generation: 6/10 — can produce alternative parses by varying edge labels, but hypothesis space is constrained to predefined relation types.  
Implementability: 8/10 — relies only on numpy for matrix ops and stdlib for regex, GIS, and topological sort; no external libraries or GPU needed.
