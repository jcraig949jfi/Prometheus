## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm: Bayesian Type‑Checked Constraint Propagation (BTCP)**  

*Data structures*  
- **Type graph**: a directed acyclic graph where nodes are simple types (e.g., `Num`, `Bool`, `Prop`) and edges represent subtype or dependent‑type relationships (built from a small hand‑coded hierarchy).  
- **Belief matrix** `B ∈ ℝ^{n×k}`: for each extracted proposition `i` (row) and each possible truth value `j∈{0,1}` (column) we store a log‑odds score; initialized from priors (e.g., 0 for neutral).  
- **Constraint set** `C`: a list of tuples `(op, i, j, …)` where `op` ∈ {`EQ`, `NEQ`, `LT`, `GT`, `AND`, `OR`, `IMP`, `NOT`} and indices refer to propositions.  

*Operations*  
1. **Structural parsing** (regex + shallow dependency parse) extracts atomic propositions and assigns them a provisional type: numbers → `Num`, predicates → `Prop`, comparatives → `Num`‑`Num` relations, conditionals → `IMP`. Negations flip the polarity flag.  
2. **Type checking**: each proposition is placed in the type graph; if a proposition’s asserted type conflicts with its inferred type (e.g., treating a `Num` as `Prop`), its prior log‑odds is shifted by a large negative penalty (`-10`).  
3. **Bayesian update**: for each constraint, compute the likelihood of the observed truth values under a simple noise model (e.g., flip probability 0.1). Using log‑odds, update `B` via additive rule: `log_post = log_prior + log_likelihood`. Iterate until convergence (≤5 passes) – this is a loopy belief propagation on a factor graph whose factors are the constraints.  
4. **Emergence score**: after convergence, compute the joint entropy `H = -∑_i ∑_j p_{ij} log p_{ij}` where `p_{ij}=sigmoid(B_{ij})`. Low entropy indicates that macro‑level consistency (emergent coherence) has arisen from micro‑level propositions; the final answer score is `-H` (higher = better).  

*Structural features parsed*  
- Numeric values and units (for `Num` type)  
- Comparatives (`>`, `<`, `≥`, `≤`, `equal to`) → ordering constraints  
- Negations (`not`, `no`) → polarity flip  
- Conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`) → `IMP` constraints  
- Causal verbs (`cause`, `lead to`, `result in`) → treated as `IMP` with a confidence weight  
- Conjunctions/disjunctions (`and`, `or`) → `AND`/`OR` factors  
- Quantifiers (`all`, `some`, `none`) → mapped to universal/existential constraints over sets of propositions  

*Novelty*  
The combination mirrors recent neuro‑symbolic hybrids (e.g., DeepProbLog, Neuro‑Symbolic Concept Learner) but replaces the neural component with a pure deterministic type system and constraint‑propagation engine. No existing open‑source tool uses a explicit type graph to penalize mismatched semantic categories before Bayesian belief propagation, making the BTCP approach structurally novel while still grounded in well‑known algorithms (belief propagation, type checking).  

*Ratings*  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical dependencies and uncertainty updates effectively for structured reasoning tasks.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — can detect inconsistencies via entropy but lacks explicit self‑reflection on its own confidence beyond the model.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — generates implicit hypotheses through constraint satisfaction but does not propose novel candidates outside the parsed set.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex, numpy arrays, and simple graph operations; easily coded in <200 lines.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Bayesian Inference**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Emergence**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 34% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.
- **Type Theory**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 

- Emergence + Type Theory: strong positive synergy (+0.431). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Holography Principle + Emergence + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Active Inference + Mechanism Design + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Analogical Reasoning + Pragmatism + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
