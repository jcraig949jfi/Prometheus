## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
We define a class `ChaoticBanditScorer` that scores a candidate answer `a` against a reference prompt `p`.  

1. **Baseline structural score** – Parse `p` and `a` into a directed constraint graph `G` whose nodes are atomic propositions extracted by regex (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric values, causal cues, ordering relations). Edges encode logical relations (e.g., modus ponens, transitivity). A deterministic satisfaction function `score(G)` (implemented with NumPy boolean arrays) returns a value in `[0,1]` proportional to the fraction of satisfied constraints.  

2. **Property‑based mutation arms** – Each arm corresponds to a mutation operator drawn from a Hypothesis‑style grammar:  
   - token‑swap,  
   - numeric perturbation (±ε),  
   - negation insertion/removal,  
   - comparative reversal,  
   - causal clause deletion.  
   For arm `i` we store `n_i` (times pulled) and `μ_i` (average reward).  

3. **Bandit selection** – At each iteration `t` we compute the Upper Confidence Bound  
   `UCB_i = μ_i + c * sqrt(log(t) / (n_i+1))` (with `c=0.5`) and pull the arm with maximal `UCB_i`.  

4. **Chaos‑theoretic reward** – After applying the selected mutation to `a` obtaining `a'`, we compute `Δ = |score(G(a')) - score(G(a))|` and `δ = ‖a' - a‖₁` (Hamming distance over tokens). The reward for the arm is the **local Lyapunov estimate**  
   `r = log(Δ + ε) / log(δ + ε)` (ε = 1e‑8 to avoid division by zero). Larger `r` means the answer’s score is highly sensitive to tiny perturbations — indicative of weak reasoning.  

5. **Update & scoring** – Update `n_i`, `μ_i` with the observed reward. After a budget `T` (e.g., 200 pulls) we compute the average Lyapunov exponent `Λ = (1/T) Σ r_t`. The final score is  
   `S = score(G(a)) * exp(-Λ)`, penalizing answers whose logical structure is fragile under systematic, property‑based perturbations.  

**Structural features parsed**  
- Negations (`not`, `no`)  
- Comparatives (`greater than`, `less than`, `≥`, `≤`)  
- Conditionals (`if … then`, `unless`)  
- Numeric values and units  
- Causal claims (`because`, `due to`, `leads to`)  
- Ordering relations (`before`, `after`, `first`, `last`)  

These are token‑level regex patterns that feed the constraint graph.  

**Novelty**  
While each component — property‑based testing, multi‑armed bandits, and Lyapunov‑style sensitivity — exists separately, their tight integration to produce a dynamic, exploration‑driven robustness metric for textual reasoning has not been reported in the literature. The approach combines automated input generation, adaptive exploration of perturbation types, and a chaos‑theoretic sensitivity measure, forming a novel scoring algorithm.  

**Rating**  
Reasoning: 7/10 — The method captures logical sensitivity but relies on a simplified satisfaction model; deeper semantic reasoning would improve it.  
Metacognition: 5/10 — No explicit self‑monitoring of uncertainty beyond bandit confidence; limited reflective capability.  
Hypothesis generation: 8/10 — Property‑based mutations systematically generate diverse hypotheses about answer weaknesses.  
Implementability: 6/10 — Requires careful regex parsing and NumPy‑based constraint propagation; feasible but non‑trivial to debug.
