## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm: Critical‑Attention Abstract Interpreter (CAAI)**  

*Data structures*  
- **Token array** `T ∈ ℝ^{L×d}`: each token (word or sub‑word) mapped to a fixed‑size feature vector via a deterministic embedding (e.g., one‑hot POS tag + normalized position + lexical polarity). `L` = sentence length, `d` = 8 (POS, dependency depth, negation flag, comparative flag, causal flag, numeric flag, ordering flag, token length). Built with only `numpy` and the stdlib.  
- **Attention weight matrix** `A ∈ ℝ^{L×L}`: computed as a softmax over scaled dot‑product similarity of `T`: `A_{ij}=exp((T_i·T_j)/√d)/∑_k exp((T_i·T_k)/√d)`.  
- **Criticality mask** `C ∈ {0,1}^{L}`: tokens whose feature variance across a sliding window of size w=3 exceeds a threshold τ (computed from the global variance of each feature dimension). This marks tokens at the “edge of order/disorder” (high local surprisal).  
- **Abstract state** `S`: a set of interval constraints over numeric tokens and a Boolean lattice over propositional tokens (True/False/Unknown). Initialized from lexical flags (e.g., a numeric token → interval [value,value]; a negation flag → flips the Boolean of its sibling).  

*Operations*  
1. **Propagation step** – for each token i, compute a weighted update of its abstract state using attention:  
   `S_i ← ⊕_{j} A_{ij} ⊗ S_j` where `⊕` is lattice join (interval union / Boolean OR) and `⊗` is meeting with the token’s own feature mask (e.g., if token j is a comparative, apply `<` or `>` relation to the interval).  
2. **Criticality gating** – update only if `C_i=1`: `S_i ← S_i` else keep previous state. This focuses computation on boundary‑region tokens where small changes can cause large state shifts (analogous to susceptibility divergence).  
3. **Fix‑point iteration** – repeat propagation until `S` stabilizes (no change in any interval bound or Boolean value) or a max of 5 iterations (guaranteed termination because the lattice height is finite).  

*Scoring logic*  
- For a candidate answer, parse it into the same token/feature representation and run the CAAI to obtain its final abstract state `S_ans`.  
- Compute a **consistency score** with the question’s abstract state `S_q` (obtained by running CAAI on the question alone):  
  `score = 1 – (|S_ans ⊖ S_q| / |S_q|)`, where `⊖` is lattice distance (interval length difference + Hamming distance on Boolean unknowns).  
- The score lies in `[0,1]`; higher means the answer respects the inferred constraints (numeric ranges, polarity, ordering) derived from the question.  

*Structural features parsed*  
- Negations (via `¬` flag on tokens).  
- Comparatives & superlatives (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, “most”, “least”).  
- Conditionals (“if … then …”) – flagged as implication nodes that propagate antecedent truth to consequent.  
- Numeric values and units – turned into interval constraints.  
- Causal cues (“because”, “leads to”) – create directed dependency edges that influence interval propagation.  
- Ordering relations (“before”, “after”, “first”, “last”) – encoded as precedence constraints on event tokens.  

*Novelty*  
The triple blend is not found in existing NLP scoring tools. Attention‑style weighting is common, but coupling it with a criticality mask derived from local feature variance and an abstract‑interpretation fix‑point solver over a combined numeric‑Boolean lattice is unprecedented in lightweight, numpy‑only evaluators. Prior work uses either pure attention similarity or separate symbolic reasoners; CAAI merges them in a single iterative propagation scheme.

**Rating**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures numeric, logical, and pragmatic constraints via a principled fix‑point loop.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the method can detect when its abstract state is unstable (high criticality) but does not explicitly reason about its own uncertainty.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — generates implicit hypotheses (interval updates) yet lacks a mechanism to propose alternative interpretations beyond the fixed‑point.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on numpy array ops and stdlib data structures; no external libraries or training required.
