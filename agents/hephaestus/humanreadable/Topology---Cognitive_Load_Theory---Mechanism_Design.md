## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm – Topology‑Aware Cognitive‑Load Mechanism Scorer (TACLMS)**  

1. **Data structures**  
   * `Prop` – a string identifier for each extracted proposition (e.g., “X > Y”).  
   * `Graph = {Prop: set[(Prop, rel, weight)]} ` – adjacency list where `rel ∈ {IMP, EQU, NEG, CAUS}` and `weight` is a real‑valued confidence from the regex extractor (default 1.0).  
   * `Chunks = list[set[Prop]]` – a partition of `Prop` limited by a working‑memory capacity `W` (e.g., 4).  
   * `Gold` – the same structure built from the reference answer.  

2. **Parsing (structural features)**  
   Using only `re` we extract:  
   * **Negations** (`not`, `no`, `-`) → `NEG` edge with weight 1.  
   * **Comparatives** (`>`, `<`, `≥`, `≤`, `more than`, `less than`) → `IMP` edge (e.g., `A > B` → `A IMP B`).  
   * **Conditionals** (`if … then …`, `unless`) → `IMP` edge.  
   * **Causal claims** (`because`, `leads to`, `results in`) → `CAUS` edge.  
   * **Numeric values** and **ordering relations** (`=`, `≠`) → `EQU` or `NEG` edges.  
   Each triple `(src, rel, dst, weight)` is inserted into `Graph`.  

3. **Constraint propagation & topology**  
   * Run Tarjan’s strongly‑connected‑components algorithm (stdlib) to detect cycles.  
   * If a component contains both an `IMP` and its converse `NEG`, mark it as inconsistent; add a penalty `P_cycle = λ_cycle * |component|`.  
   * Otherwise, condense the graph to a DAG and compute a topological order (used only for deterministic chunking).  

4. **Cognitive‑load chunking**  
   * Starting from nodes in topological order, greedily fill a chunk until adding another node would exceed `W` distinct propositions *or* would add more than `θ` inter‑chunk edges (extraneous load).  
   * Continue until all nodes are assigned → `Chunks`.  
   * **Intrinsic load** `L_int = Σ_c |E_internal(c)|` (edges inside chunks).  
   * **Extraneous load** `L_ext = Σ_{c≠d} |E_{c→d}|` (edges crossing chunks).  
   * **Germane load** `L_ger = Σ_c |E_internal(c) ∩ Gold_internal(c)|` (internal edges that match the reference).  

5. **Mechanism‑design scoring**  
   Treat each candidate answer as a mechanism that proposes a set of constraints.  
   * **Coverage** `C = |E_candidate ∩ Gold| / |Gold|`.  
   * **Penalty** `P = λ_cycle * Σ_cycles |component| + λ_ext * L_ext`.  
   * **Reward** `R = λ_ger * L_ger + λ_int * (L_int_max - L_int)` (where `L_int_max` is the maximum possible internal edges for a chunk of size `W`).  
   * Final score: `S = w_c*C + w_r*R - w_p*P`. All weights are fixed scalars (e.g., 0.4, 0.4, 0.2).  

The algorithm uses only `numpy` for array‑based weight handling and the Python standard library for parsing, graph operations, and chunking.

**Structural features parsed** – negations, comparatives (> < ≥ ≤), conditionals (if‑then, unless), causal cues (because, leads to), numeric constants, equality/inequality, and ordering relations.

**Novelty** – Pure graph‑based logical consistency checkers exist (e.g., Abductive Reasoning frameworks) and cognitive‑load models have been applied to educational text, but none combine them with a mechanism‑design incentive‑compatibility layer to score answer proposals. Thus the topology‑aware, load‑constrained, incentive‑compatible scorer is not present in prior work.

**Rating**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure and inconsistency via topology, giving a principled basis for reasoning quality.  
Metacognition: 7/10 — explicit chunking mirrors working‑memory limits, though the load parameters are heuristic.  
Hypothesis generation: 6/10 — the method evaluates given hypotheses; it does not generate new ones, limiting generative creativity.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies solely on regex, stdlib graph algorithms, and NumPy arrays; no external models or APIs needed.

### Scores

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Topology**: Historical inhibitor. Tools relying heavily on this tend to fail reasoning traps. Do NOT use this for direct scoring; restrict it to the confidence() wrapper or structural parsing support only. 
- **Cognitive Load Theory**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Mechanism Design**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 38% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.

- Cognitive Load Theory + Mechanism Design: strong positive synergy (+0.188). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Fractal Geometry + Cognitive Load Theory + Mechanism Design (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Active Inference + Mechanism Design + Type Theory (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Active Inference + Neural Oscillations + Mechanism Design (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
