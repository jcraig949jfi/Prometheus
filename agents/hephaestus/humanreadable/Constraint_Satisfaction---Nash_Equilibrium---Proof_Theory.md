## Nous Analysis

We propose a hybrid scorer that treats each candidate answer as a strategy in a normal‑form game whose payoffs are derived from a constraint‑satisfaction problem (CSP) enriched with proof‑theoretic normalization.  

**Data structures**  
- `Predicates`: list of atomic propositions extracted with regex (e.g., `X > Y`, `¬Cause(A,B)`, `If P then Q`). Each predicate gets a Boolean variable index.  
- `Constraint graph`: adjacency matrix `C` where `C[i,j]` encodes a binary constraint between predicates *i* and *j* (implication, mutual exclusion, transitivity, numeric inequality).  
- `Utility matrix` `U`: size *n × n* for *n* candidates; `U[i,j]` is the payoff to candidate *i* when the opponent plays *j*.  

**Operations**  
1. **Parsing** – regex patterns pull out negations (`not`, `no`), comparatives (`>`, `<`, `≥`, `≤`), conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`), causal markers (`because`, `leads to`), numeric tokens, and ordering phrases (`more than`, `less than`, `equal to`). Each match yields a predicate and its polarity.  
2. **CSP construction** – for every extracted rule we add a constraint:  
   - `If P then Q` → clause `¬P ∨ Q` (encoded as implication `P → Q`).  
   - Negation → mutual exclusion `¬(P ∧ ¬P)`.  
   - Comparatives/numerics → linear inequality constraints (e.g., `value_X - value_Y ≥ 0`).  
   - Transitivity of ordering → chain constraints `X > Y ∧ Y > Z → X > Z`.  
3. **Arc consistency (AC‑3)** – iteratively prune domains of predicate Booleans using `numpy`‑based matrix updates until a fixed point or failure. The number of remaining unsatisfied constraints `sat_i` is recorded for each candidate *i*.  
4. **Proof‑theoretic normalization** – apply cut‑elimination locally: if both `P → Q` and `Q → R` are present, replace them with the derived `P → R` and remove the intermediate cut. This reduces the constraint graph, improving propagation efficiency.  
5. **Payoff definition** – `U[i,j] = -sat_i + λ * agreement(i,j)`, where `agreement(i,j)` counts predicates both candidates assert identically and λ balances constraint satisfaction vs. mutual support.  
6. **Nash equilibrium** – solve the symmetric zero‑sum game defined by `U` using linear programming (`numpy.linalg.lstsq` on the best‑response conditions) to obtain mixed‑strategy probabilities `p*`. The final score for candidate *i* is `p*_i`.  

**Structural features parsed** – negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal claims, numeric values, ordering relations, and conjunction/disjunction markers.  

**Novelty** – While CSP solvers and proof normalization appear separately in QA rerankers, and Nash equilibria have been used in debate‑style scoring, the tight integration of arc‑consistency propagation, cut‑elimination preprocessing, and equilibrium‑based payoff computation is not documented in existing literature, making the combination novel.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical structure and global consistency via constraint propagation and equilibrium reasoning.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — the method evaluates consistency but does not explicitly monitor its own reasoning process or adjust search depth.  
Hypothesis generation: 7/10 — treats each candidate as a alternative strategy, implicitly generating competing hypotheses through the game‑theoretic framework.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex (std lib), numpy for matrix/linear‑algebra ops, and AC‑3; no external libraries or APIs needed.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Proof Theory**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Proof Theory + Constraint Satisfaction + Normalized Compression Distance (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Proof Theory + Constraint Satisfaction + Compositional Semantics (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Bayesian Inference + Constraint Satisfaction + Free Energy Principle (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
