## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm – TopoKalman Falsifier**

1. **Parsing & Graph Construction**  
   - Use regex to extract elementary propositions from each sentence of a candidate answer.  
   - Detect linguistic cues: negations (`not`, `no`), comparatives (`more than`, `less than`), conditionals (`if … then`), causal markers (`because`, `leads to`), ordering terms (`before`, `after`, `first`, `last`), and numeric expressions with units.  
   - Each proposition becomes a node `i`. Directed edges are added when a cue relates two propositions (e.g., “A because B” → edge B→A; “A if B” → edge B→A). The resulting structure is a directed graph `G = (V,E)`.

2. **Topological Features**  
   - Compute the number of weakly connected components `C` using a union‑find on the undirected version of `G`.  
   - Compute the first Betti number `β₁` (count of independent cycles) via `β₁ = |E| - |V| + C`.  
   - These quantities capture holes and fragmentation in the argument’s logical topology.

3. **Kalman‑style Belief Propagation**  
   - State vector `xₖ ∈ ℝ^{|V|}` holds the belief (probability of truth) for each node at step `k` (sentence order).  
   - Initialize `x₀ = 0.5·1`, covariance `P₀ = I`.  
   - **Prediction:** `x̂ₖ = F·xₖ₋₁`, `P̂ₖ = F·Pₖ₋₁·Fᵀ + Q`.  
     - `F` is a transition matrix derived from the graph Laplacian `L = D−A` (degree minus adjacency) smoothed: `F = I − αL`, with small `α` (e.g., 0.1) to enforce diffusion of belief across edges.  
     - `Q = q·I` models process noise.  
   - **Update (Falsification measurement):**  
     - For each node `i`, compute a falsifiability indicator `zᵢₖ`:  
       `zᵢₖ = 1` if the proposition contains a falsifiable claim (e.g., a comparative or causal statement) **and** no explicit negation or counter‑example token appears in the same sentence; otherwise `zᵢₖ = 0`.  
     - Measurement matrix `H = I`.  
     - Innovation `yₖ = zₖ − H·x̂ₖ`, covariance `Sₖ = H·P̂ₖ·Hᵀ + R` (`R = r·I`).  
     - Kalman gain `Kₖ = P̂ₖ·Hᵀ·Sₖ⁻¹`.  
     - Updated state `xₖ = x̂ₖ + Kₖ·yₖ`, covariance `Pₖ = (I−Kₖ·H)·P̂ₖ`.  
   - After processing all sentences, the final belief vector `x_T` reflects how well each claim survived falsification attempts while being smoothed by the argument’s topology.

4. **Scoring Logic**  
   - Base score = mean(`x_T`).  
   - Topological penalty = `λ₁·(C−1) + λ₂·β₁` (λ₁, λ₂ small, e.g., 0.05).  
   - Final score = base score × exp(−penalty).  
   - Scores lie in `[0,1]`; higher values indicate a coherent, well‑connected set of propositions that resist falsification.

**Structural Features Parsed**  
Negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal keywords, ordering relations, numeric values with units, and explicit counter‑example tokens (“however”, “but”, “except”).

**Novelty**  
While graph‑based coherence models and Bayesian/Kalman updating appear separately in QA and argument mining, the specific fusion of topological invariants (components, cycles) with a Kalman filter driven by Popperian falsifiability measurements is not documented in existing literature, making the combination novel.

**Rating**

Reasoning: 7/10 — captures logical structure and uncertainty propagation but lacks deep semantic understanding.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — belief variance provides a rudimentary self‑monitor of confidence.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — generates falsifiable propositions via extraction, but does not invent novel hypotheses beyond the text.  
Implementability: 8/10 — relies only on regex, NumPy linear algebra, and standard‑library data structures.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Topology**: Historical inhibitor. Tools relying heavily on this tend to fail reasoning traps. Do NOT use this for direct scoring; restrict it to the confidence() wrapper or structural parsing support only. 
- **Kalman Filtering**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Falsificationism**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 34% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.

- Falsificationism + Kalman Filtering: strong positive synergy (+0.601). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Kalman Filtering + Falsificationism + Nash Equilibrium (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Thermodynamics + Kalman Filtering + Falsificationism (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Apoptosis + Falsificationism + Self-Organized Criticality (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
