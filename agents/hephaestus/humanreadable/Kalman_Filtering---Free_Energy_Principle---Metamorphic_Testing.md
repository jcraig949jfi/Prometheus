## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
We treat each candidate answer as a noisy observation of an underlying logical state *z* ∈ ℝᵏ, where each dimension corresponds to the truth‑value of an extracted proposition (e.g., “X > Y”, “¬P”, “if A then B”).  

1. **Parsing & state vector construction** – Using regex‑based patterns we extract:  
   * atomic predicates (noun‑verb‑noun triples),  
   * negations (`not`, `no`),  
   * comparatives (`>`, `<`, `≥`, `≤`, “more … than”),  
   * conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`),  
   * numeric constants,  
   * causal cues (`because`, `leads to`),  
   * ordering terms (`first`, `second`, `before`, `after`).  
   Each predicate gets an index *i*; we form a binary indicator vector *h* ∈ {0,1}ᵏ marking which predicates appear in the answer.  

2. **Prior belief (Kalman initialization)** – Assume a Gaussian prior 𝒩(μ₀, Σ₀) with μ₀ = 0.5·1 (complete ignorance) and Σ₀ = I·σ₀² (σ₀² = 1).  

3. **Metamorphic relations as measurement model** – For each logical transformation *T* that preserves validity (e.g., double‑input → output‑double, negation flips truth, monotonic ordering preserves direction), we define a linear measurement matrix *H_T* such that the expected observation is *ẑ* = *H_T z*. The actual observation *y* is derived from the answer’s extracted predicates after applying *T* (e.g., if the answer says “X > Y”, the metamorphic relation “swap X and Y” yields an observation that should be false).  

4. **Prediction‑error & Free Energy** – Compute innovation ε = y − H_T μ₋ (where μ₋, Σ₋ are prior mean/covariance). Precision (inverse variance) Λ = (H_T Σ₋ H_Tᵀ + R)⁻¹, with measurement noise R = σᵣ²·I (σᵣ² = 0.1). The variational free energy contribution is F_T = ½ εᵀ Λ ε + ½ log|Λ| + const.  

5. **Kalman update (error minimization)** – Gain K = Σ₋ H_Tᵀ Λ; posterior μ₊ = μ₋ + K ε; Σ₊ = (I − K H_T) Σ₋. Iterate over all metamorphic relations extracted from the prompt‑answer pair.  

6. **Scoring** – After processing all relations, total free energy F = Σ_T F_T. The final score = −F (lower prediction error → higher score). All operations use NumPy arrays; no external libraries are needed.

**Structural features parsed** – negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric constants, causal verbs, ordering/sequential terms, quantifiers (“all”, “some”), and modal auxiliaries (“must”, “might”).

**Novelty** – While Kalman filtering and variational free energy appear separately in Bayesian cognitive models, and metamorphic testing is used in software validation, their joint application to score textual reasoning via linear‑Gaussian belief updates over extracted logical propositions has not been reported in the literature. The approach resembles probabilistic soft logic but replaces weighted rule inference with a recursive prediction‑error minimization loop.

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — captures logical consistency via error propagation, though limited to linear approximations.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — monitors prediction error but lacks explicit self‑reflection on model adequacy.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — generates implicit hypotheses (updated means) but does not propose alternative structures.  
Implementability: 9/10 — relies only on regex, NumPy linear algebra, and basic loops; straightforward to code in <150 lines.
