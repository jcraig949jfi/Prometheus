## Nous Analysis

**Algorithm**  
1. **Parsing & Feature Extraction** – Using regular expressions and a small rule‑based parser (stdlib `re`), each sentence is converted into a set of atomic predicates:  
   - `Prop(name, polarity)` for propositions (negation flips polarity).  
   - `Comp(subj, obj, op)` for comparatives (`>`, `<`, `=`, `≥`, `≤`).  
   - `Cond(antecedent, consequent)` for conditionals.  
   - `Num(entity, value, unit)` for numeric expressions.  
   - `Cause(effect, cause)` for causal cues (“because”, “leads to”).  
   - `Ord(a, b, rel)` for ordering (“before”, “after”).  
   Predicates are stored as tuples in a list `P`.  

2. **Sparse Dictionary Learning** – A fixed binary dictionary `D ∈ {0,1}^{m×k}` (m = number of possible predicate types, k = dictionary size) is pre‑learned offline via an iterative hard‑thresholding SVD (numpy only). Each predicate tuple is one‑hot encoded into a vector `x ∈ {0,1}^m`. Sparse coding solves `min‖x - D z‖₂² + λ‖z‖₀` using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) with numpy, yielding a sparse coefficient vector `z ∈ ℝ^k` (typically <5 non‑zeros). The sparse representation `z` is the candidate’s feature vector.  

3. **Pragmatic Constraint Generation** – Grice’s maxims are encoded as soft logical constraints:  
   - **Quantity**: penalize extra predicates not implied by context.  
   - **Quality**: penalize predicates contradicting known facts (hard SAT clauses).  
   - **Relation**: add implicature clauses (e.g., if `Cond(A,B)` present, expect `B` unless contradicted).  
   - **Manner**: penalize overly complex `z` (higher ℓ₀ norm).  
   These become a weighted MAX‑SAT problem: hard clauses = factual consistency; soft clause weights = pragmatic scores.  

4. **Scoring** – Run a simple DPLL‑style SAT solver (numpy arrays for clause literals) to find a satisfying assignment for the hard clauses. If unsatisfiable, return score 0. If satisfiable, compute:  
   `score = Σ soft_weight_i * satisfied_i  -  α * ‖z‖₀`  
   where `α` balances sparsity. Higher scores indicate answers that are logically consistent, pragmatically appropriate, and compact.  

**Structural Features Parsed**  
Negations (`not`, `n’t`), comparatives (`more than`, `less than`, `≥`, `≤`), conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`), numeric values with units, causal cues (`because`, `leads to`, `results in`), ordering relations (`before`, `after`, `precede`, `follow`).  

**Novelty**  
The combination resembles neuro‑symbolic approaches (e.g., Logic Tensor Networks) but replaces neural encoders with a deterministic sparse coding step and treats pragmatics as weighted MAX‑SAT constraints. Sparse autoencoders for logical forms have been explored (e.g., sparse coding of first‑order clauses), and pragmatics‑aware SAT appears in computational discourse models, yet the end‑to‑end pipeline — regex → sparse OMP → MAX‑SAT scoring — is not documented in the literature, making it novel in this specific formulation.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 8/10 — The algorithm captures logical consistency and pragmatic nuance via exact SAT solving and sparse feature selection, offering stronger reasoning than pure similarity baselines.  
Metacognition: 6/10 — It can detect when an answer violates its own sparsity or pragmatic constraints, but lacks explicit self‑reflection on why a constraint failed.  
Hypothesis generation: 5/10 — While it can propose alternative predicate sets that improve the score, generating novel hypotheses beyond the parsed predicate space requires additional generative components.  
Implementability: 9/10 — All steps rely on numpy and the Python standard library; OMP, DPLL SAT, and regex parsing are straightforward to code without external dependencies.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Sparse Autoencoders**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 37% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.
- **Pragmatics**: Moderate positive synergy. Use this concept to support the primary logic, perhaps as a secondary validation step or scoring modifier.  GOODHART WARNING: This concept scores well on static tests but only 36% adversarial survival. Ensure your implementation handles paraphrased, shuffled, and extended versions of prompts, not just the literal patterns.
- **Satisfiability**: Historical inhibitor. Tools relying heavily on this tend to fail reasoning traps. Do NOT use this for direct scoring; restrict it to the confidence() wrapper or structural parsing support only. 

- Pragmatics + Sparse Autoencoders: strong positive synergy (+0.297). These concepts reinforce each other — integrate them tightly rather than implementing as independent checks.

Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Ergodic Theory + Sparse Autoencoders + Pragmatics (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Pragmatics + Hoare Logic + Satisfiability (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Sparse Autoencoders + Pragmatics + Multi-Armed Bandits (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
