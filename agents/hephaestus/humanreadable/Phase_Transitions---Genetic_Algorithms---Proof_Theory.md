## Nous Analysis

The algorithm builds a mutable proof‑graph from each candidate answer and evolves it with a genetic algorithm whose mutation rate is tuned by a phase‑transition‑like diversity threshold.  

**Data structures**  
- `clauses`: list of Horn‑style tuples `(head, body)` where `head` and `body` are strings extracted by regex (e.g., `"X > Y"`).  
- `adj`: NumPy boolean matrix `[n_clauses, n_clauses]` indicating implication edges (`adj[i,j]=1` if body of i contains head of j).  
- `feat`: NumPy float vector of length *k* counting structural features (negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal tokens, numeric values, ordering relations).  
- `population`: list of candidate proof‑graphs, each represented by a clause subset and its `adj`.  

**Operations**  
1. **Parsing** – regex extracts atomic predicates and connects them into `clauses`; builds initial `adj`.  
2. **Normalization (cut‑elimination)** – iteratively removes any clause whose head is derivable from its body via transitive closure (`adj @ adj`), yielding a reduced proof‑graph.  
3. **Fitness** – `f = w1 * proof_len + w2 * violation_cnt + w3 * ||feat_ref - feat_cand||₂`.  
   - `proof_len` = number of clauses after normalization.  
   - `violation_cnt` = count of unresolved literals (body atoms not present as any head).  
   - `feat_ref` is the feature vector of a gold answer (or empty for unsupervised scoring).  
4. **Genetic step** – tournament selection, one‑point crossover swapping contiguous clause blocks, mutation: with probability `μ` either (a) insert a randomly sampled clause from the parse set, (b) delete a clause, or (c) flip a literal’s polarity.  
5. **Phase‑transition control** – compute Shannon entropy `H` of clause presence across the population each generation. If `H < H_c` (empirically ~0.3 of max), increase `μ` by factor 1.2; if `H > H_c`, decrease `μ` by factor 0.8. This creates an abrupt shift in search dynamics analogous to a phase transition.  
6. **Termination** – after `G` generations or when improvement < ε, return the best individual’s score `S = 1 / (1 + f)`.  

**Parsed structural features** – negations (`not`, `no`), comparatives (`>`, `<`, `≥`, `≤`, `more than`, `less than`), conditionals (`if … then …`, `unless`), causal claims (`because`, `leads to`, `results in`), ordering relations (`before`, `after`, `preceded by`, `followed by`), numeric values with units, and quantifiers (`all`, `some`, `none`).  

**Novelty** – Pure genetic algorithms have been used for program synthesis, and proof‑theoretic normalization is standard in automated theorem proving, but coupling GA search with an entropy‑driven mutation rate that mimics a phase transition has not been reported in the literature for answer scoring. Hence the approach is moderately novel.  

**Ratings**  
Reasoning: 7/10 — captures logical structure and optimizes proof‑like explanations, but relies on shallow regex parsing.  
Metacognition: 5/10 — entropy‑based mutation gives rudimentary self‑monitoring of search diversity, yet no explicit reflection on answer correctness.  
Hypothesis generation: 6/10 — GA explores alternative proof hypotheses; quality limited by mutation operators and feature representation.  
Implementability: 8/10 — all components use only NumPy and the Python standard library; feasible to code in <200 lines.
