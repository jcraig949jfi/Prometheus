## Nous Analysis

The algorithm builds a lightweight factor graph from parsed propositions. Each proposition pᵢ is extracted via regex patterns that capture: negation (“not X”), comparatives (“X > Y”, “X < Y”), conditionals (“if X then Y”), causal verbs (“X because Y”, “X leads to Y”), numeric expressions with units, and ordering/temporal markers (“before”, “after”, “first”, “last”). The parsed triple (subject, relation, object) is stored as a row in a NumPy array E (shape n × 3) where the relation column is one‑hot encoded into a fixed set of relation types (¬, >, <, →, cause, order, eq). A confidence weight cᵢ∈[0,1] is initialized from a metacognitive prior: the system estimates its own calibration on a small validation set of similar questions (e.g., via Brier score) and uses that to set a Dirichlet prior α₀ = β₀·cᵢ for each proposition.

Belief propagation treats each proposition as a binary variable (true/false). The factor graph encodes logical constraints: for each implication X→Y a factor ψ(X,Y)=1 if ¬X ∨ Y else ε (small penalty); for negation ¬X a factor ψ(X)=1−X; for comparatives a factor that evaluates the numeric sub‑expression using NumPy and returns 1 if satisfied else ε. The joint probability is proportional to ∏ᵢ Dirichlet(pᵢ|α₀,β₀) · ∏ₖ ψₖ. Inference proceeds with loopy belief propagation implemented as matrix‑vector updates: messages mᵢ→ⱼ are computed as the product of incoming messages and the local factor, all done with NumPy dot products; after T ≈ 10 iterations the marginal pᵢ ≈ belief that pᵢ is true is obtained.

Each candidate answer Aⱼ is translated into a set of propositional constraints (e.g., “Answer says X>Y”). The score Sⱼ = ∏ᵢ pᵢ^{matchᵢⱼ} · (1−pᵢ)^{1−matchᵢⱼ}, where matchᵢⱼ = 1 if the candidate asserts the proposition’s truth value, else 0. The final score is normalized across candidates. This yields a graded belief that combines evidence (parsed structure), prior self‑knowledge (metacognition), and a global consistency pressure reminiscent of holographic boundary constraints (the product of all factors acts as a boundary‑encoded regularizer).

The approach parses negations, comparatives, conditionals, causal claims, numeric values with units, and ordering/temporal relations. It does not rely on surface similarity but on logical constraint satisfaction.

Novelty: While Bayesian networks and belief propagation are standard, coupling them with a metacognitive Dirichlet prior derived from self‑calibration and treating the global factor product as a holographic‑style boundary constraint is not commonly found in existing reasoning‑scoring tools. Some works use Bayesian priors or constraint propagation, but the triple combination is undocumented.

Reasoning: 7/10 — The method captures logical structure and updates beliefs rigorously, but approximations in loopy BP may miss higher‑order interactions.
Metacognition: 8/10 — Using self‑calibration to shape priors adds a genuine reflective layer absent in most scorers.
Hypothesis generation: 6/10 — The system evaluates given candidates; it does not generate new hypotheses beyond the supplied set.
Implementability: 8/10 — All steps rely on regex, NumPy array ops, and simple loops; no external libraries or APIs are needed.

## Coeus Causal Intelligence

The following concepts have historical causal signatures regarding their ability to form computable reasoning tools. Adjust your implementation strategy accordingly:

- **Bayesian Inference**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 
- **Holography Principle**: Historical inhibitor. Tools relying heavily on this tend to fail reasoning traps. Do NOT use this for direct scoring; restrict it to the confidence() wrapper or structural parsing support only. 
- **Metacognition**: Causally neutral. Implement as requested without over-indexing on its mechanics. 


Similar combinations that forged successfully:
- Bayesian Inference + Constraint Satisfaction + Free Energy Principle (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Bayesian Inference + Differentiable Programming + Abductive Reasoning (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)
- Bayesian Inference + Evolution + Criticality (accuracy: 0%, calibration: 0%)

GLOBAL: The final tool must strictly beat the NCD compression baseline. Use structural parsing (negations, comparatives, conditionals, numeric evaluation) as the primary scoring signal. NCD is only a tiebreaker for candidates where no structural signal is detected.
