# HITL Log — questions & comments for James (non-blocking; loop continues regardless)

Newest first. Answer any of these whenever; replies get folded into the next cycle.

## Cycle 001 (2026-08-21)

1. **Cadence**: you asked 90 min; the wakeup runtime caps a single delay at 60 min, so the
   loop runs ~hourly. OK, or should I alternate a no-op wake to approximate 90?
2. **R0 baseline lane**: should the R0 retrieval circuit become a permanent baseline lane in
   the grading oracle, so every reasoner's staircase reports lift-over-retrieval? My stand:
   yes (it operationalizes the counter-baseline discriminator for Band E); will wire it in a
   later cycle unless you object.
3. **KNOWN_CONSTANTS scope**: certified module ships with pi/e only (python-flint 0.9 exposes
   few arb constants directly). Catalan/Euler need arb function calls — extend on demand or
   proactively?
4. **PySR install**: Julia backend will pull ~1 GB on first run. Fine on F:? (Assuming yes;
   will use a pinned venv.)
