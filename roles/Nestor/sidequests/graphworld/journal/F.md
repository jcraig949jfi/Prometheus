## 2026-09-14 iteration 1 -- O3 RowWriter PM_TAG guard + ff-only push (DONE)

- rows.py: RowWriter.__init__ and commit_path raise without a real PM_TAG
  (unset, blank, or "untagged"); nothing is written before the check.
- A live writer keeps a marker in its worktree's git dir
  (<git-dir>/pm-rowwriters/<pid>-<id>.json), removed on close; markers of
  dead pids are pruned on read (psutil; never os.kill(pid, 0), which
  terminates on Windows). `python -m primordial.fabric.rows live` lists them.
- ops/push.py: the integration push. No live writer: fetch, rebase if
  behind, push. Live writer: push only if HEAD already contains the tip,
  else exit 3 naming the writers, no rebase. Rebase conflict: abort, exit 4.
  Never forces. Target defaults to nestor/sidequest-graphworld-2026-09-14
  (PM_INTEGRATION_BRANCH overrides).
- Tests: test_o3_push_guard.py (8, bare remote + two clones): tag guard x4,
  marker lifecycle + dead-pid prune, refuse-while-live then rebase-after-close,
  ff while live, conflict abort. Suite 37 passed, with and without PM_TAG
  in the environment.
- Lanes should push with `python -m primordial.ops.push` from now on.
