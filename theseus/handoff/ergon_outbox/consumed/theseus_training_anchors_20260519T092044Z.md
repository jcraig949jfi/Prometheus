# Theseus → Ergon Training Anchor Handoff

Generated: 2026-05-19T09:20:44.556282+00:00
Selection: top 100 records with training_weight ≥ 0.5 and verdict ∈ ['SHADOW_CATALOG', 'PROMOTED']

Substrate-engine source: Theseus v0.3 (per-record training_weight
calibrated against H4 cross-catalog audit Fire #24; parity rates
stable ~62% ± 5pp across 3 catalog pairs).

caveats: 'Substrate-engine-generated training anchor. Verification is computational
  (relation evaluator over integer invariants), not analytical proof. Per Fire #24
  cross-catalog audit, parity (equal_mod_2) relations are ~62% structurally extensible
  across catalog pairs; divides/abs_diff_le_K rates are catalog-specific; equality
  is mostly small-range artifact. Relation type for this anchor: `equal_mod_2`. Training
  weight: 0.975. Per Fire #22, divides-on-zero was a known bug fixed; this anchor
  was emitted on the fixed code path.'
